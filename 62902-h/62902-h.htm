<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">J</span>UST as the train with a salute of the engine&rsquo;s
whistle careened into full view of the smoke-blackened
shed that is known in Grand Prairie
as the depot, the sound of cheering came to Garwood&rsquo;s
ears. He was lounging in the smoking car,
his long legs stretched to the seat before him, his
face begrimed with soot and glistening with perspiration,
his whole body heavy with fatigue. But
the cheers, coming to him in a vast crescendo that
even the noise of the car-wheels as they hammered
the Wabash crossing could not drown, brought
back to his eyes the excitement that had been burning
in them for days; a smile soothed his tired
visage, and instinctively he flexed in every fiber.
For a moment he tried to hide the smile, but Rankin,
who had so successfully managed his canvass
for him, and executed that great man&oelig;uver on the
last day of the Clinton convention, which, after
one thousand two hundred and nine ballots had
nominated Garwood for Congress, heaved his bulk
from the hot, cindery, plush cushion, slapped his
candidate on the shoulder and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like it, is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Garwood let human feelings have their way
and the smile fully illumined his haggard face.
It was a strong face, clean-shaven after the old
ideal of American statesmen, that grew darker
and stronger in the shadow of the slouch hat which
he now clapped upon his long black hair. Rankin
had succeeded in raising himself to his feet, and
stood upright in the aisle, shaking himself like a
Newfoundland. He drew off the linen duster he
wore, and draped it over his arm, then seizing
his little traveling-bag, which in contrast to his
huge body looked like a mere reticule, he waved
it toward the station and said, as if he had just
conjured the presence of the crowd:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There they are, Jerry, there they are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood had risen, and through the windows
of the swaying coach he could see the faces of the
crowd. The men on board the train, most of them
members of the Polk County delegation which had
stood by him with solid, unbroken ranks, had been
yelling all the way from Clinton, and now, though
it seemed impossible that they should have any
voices left in their hoarse and swollen throats, they
raised a shout that swelled above the cheers outside
and pressing to the windows and the doors of
the coaches, they challenged their neighbors with
the exulting cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Garwood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside there rose an answering roar:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Polk County delegation, as if it demanded
confirmation, yelled again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Who&rsquo;s</i> all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the crowd rose to its tip-toes, and
the answering cry was of such immense unanimity
that it made the very platform shake:</p>

<p>&ldquo;G-a-r-wood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train had stopped, and Garwood was being
hustled toward the door. Some impatient fellows
from the platform outside who had mounted
the steps of the car, now pressed in, and stretched
their bodies incredible distances across the backs
of seats to grasp Garwood&rsquo;s hand, to seize him by
the coat, and to call in his face:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Jerry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the stuff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was oblivious of the progress he was making,
if he was making any at all, and the conductor,
although he had caught the contagious spirit of
the triumphant Polk County delegation soon after
the train left Clinton, and had shown Garwood the
deference due to a successful candidate, began to
be concerned for the time he was losing, and said
with smiling indulgence:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Big Rankin then squeezed himself in front of
Garwood, and waving his little bag dangerously before
him, crushed his way out, drawing the others
after him in his turbulent wake. Meanwhile the
passengers in the train looked on with the good-humored
toleration an American crowd always excites
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>in those not participants in its moving enthusiasms,
and mildly inquired what town that was.</p>

<p>When Garwood gained the platform of the car
and the people at last caught sight of him, the
cheering suddenly attained a new pitch of intensity,
and a band, clustered near the rotting log
where the hacks made their stand, spontaneously
crashed into &ldquo;Hail to the Chief!&rdquo; The band played
the piece in furious time, and the man who performed
on the tuba seemed to have taken upon
himself the responsibility of voicing the whole
enthusiasm of Polk County; but to Garwood,
to whom the strains came across that tossing mass
of heads and hats and faces, the music was sweet.
He felt himself suddenly choking; his eyes filled
with tears. He could not have trusted himself to
speak just then, though the cheers were being
more and more punctuated by cries of &ldquo;Speech!
Speech!&rdquo; Luckily, the man behind him, urged by
the brakeman, for the conductor, watch in hand,
was scowling, began to push, the crowd in front
held out a hundred arms to seize him, and Garwood
was swallowed up in that stifling press of
men.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the depths of the multitude Garwood
was conscious of meeting the mayor, who
took his hand, when he could reclaim it from a
score of other hands thrust forth all about him, and
then in a zigzag path of glory, he was dragged
through the throng, Rankin and the delegates
following, moving like a current in the sea.
Garwood laughed as he was pulled this way and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>that, and tried to answer each one of the thousand
greetings poured in on him from every side. The
perspiration streamed from his face. His waistcoat
had been torn open and when some one saw this
and shouted &ldquo;Look out for your watch, Jerry!&rdquo; the
whole crowd laughed delightedly at the witticism,
and Garwood himself laughed with them.</p>

<p>The crowd had been a first surprise to Garwood,
the band had been another, now a third was added
by the sight of an open carriage drawn by two
white horses. He had not expected an ovation,
which made it all the more grateful when it came,
and as he was being helped into the carriage with a
solicitude that was a new thing in men&rsquo;s treatment
of him, he expressed something of this to Rankin.
But Rankin, who had been in politics all his days
and could view the varying moods of the populace
with a politician&rsquo;s cynicism, replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if we&rsquo;d been skinned, they wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo;
been here when you needed sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth flashed upon Garwood at once, and if it
embittered for an instant his triumph when it was at
its sweetest, it seemed to give him a better control,
so that as he settled himself in the back seat of
the carriage, with the mayor beside him, and Rankin
filling the whole front seat, he rearranged his
rumpled garments, readjusted his hat, and then
looked calmly around on the crowd that swarmed
up to the carriage wheels as if they had never seen
him before. His face was calm and composed,
almost stern. It was the face he hoped to leave to
history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>As the band, to whom the leader had been distributing
the precious leaves of its most classical
number, was forming in the street, Garwood for
the first time saw many carriages, filled with men
and women who waved hats and fluttered handkerchiefs,
now that they thought he could see and
recognize them. Garwood smiled, though reservedly,
and lifted his hat with a sudden consciousness
that he, himself, at last, was the one who was lifting
the hat from the open carriage in the street,
and not some other man. He did not neglect to
smile, nor to raise his hat gallantly to each carriage
load as he swept his eye along the line of
vehicles, but he was not thinking of their occupants,
nor of himself, wholly. He was thinking of
a certain surrey he knew well, from which a pair
of eyes would smile as his did, perhaps be moistened
by tears as his had been a few minutes before,&mdash;the
eyes of one to whom all this would be as sweet
as it was to him. But the surrey was not there.
He was surprised, though in a way different from
that in which the crowd and the band and the open
carriage had surprised him. He was disappointed,
and felt himself entitled to a little shade of resentment,
to a little secret hurt at the heart. It was
the hour in the afternoon when she would be driving
down to the bank for her father. He could
not see why she had not come. Perhaps she felt
a delicacy about the publicity of it, though he did
not see why she should.</p>

<p>But the band had swung into the middle of the
street. The drum-major, in his hot bear-skin and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>tall leggings, was facing them with his baton held
horizontally before him in his two hands. He
blew the shrill whistle, clenched in his teeth, and
then, wheeling, pointed up Kaskaskia Street and
strode away for the public square. The leader
trilled two little notes on his cornet, the snare
drums rattled a long roll, and the band burst into
&ldquo;See, the Conquering Hero Comes!&rdquo; The carriage
moved, the crowd cheered again, and the little
procession began his triumphal entry for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look mad, Jerry,&rdquo; advised Rankin, in humorous
appreciation of the whole demonstration. The
remark did not exactly please Garwood, and for
an instant he did look mad, but he smiled again
and composed his features to the dignity required
of him in that hour. Some of the private carriages
followed in his train and the crowd streamed along
the sidewalks on each side of the street. A number
of small boys trudged in the deep white dust,
mingled with the band, or crowded after Garwood&rsquo;s
carriage, breaking into a trot now and then
in their determination to keep up with the procession.
Two or three of them, in order to identify
themselves more closely with the affair, laid their
dirty little hands on the panels of the carriage.
Garwood felt an inward resentment at this, and
when Rankin lolled over in his seat and snatched
the cap from the matted head of one of the boys,
and the crowd on the sidewalk laughed uproariously,
Garwood felt like rebuking him. He had a
moral conviction that at least two other boys were
swinging on the springs behind the carriage, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>he would have liked to dislodge them, but he knew
he dare not. In the last ten minutes imperial ambitions
had stirred within him. He began already
to dream of triumphal marches amid wider scenes,
with troops or at least policemen lining the curb,
and yet his politician&rsquo;s sense reminded him of the
quickness with which American voters resent any
little assumption of undemocratic airs, however
much they may like it on a larger scale. And so
when Rankin, to appease the frightened lad whose
cap he had snatched, took the youngster by the
collar and dragged him into the carriage, Garwood
felt it would be better to laugh with him and with
the crowd.</p>

<p>The procession turned into Main Street, and so
on down to the square, with its old brown court
house and its monument inscribed to the soldiers
and sailors of Polk County, though Polk County
had never had any sailors. The procession ended
at the Cassell House, though why can hardly be
told. Garwood did not live there, but all processions
of that kind in Grand Prairie end at the Cassell
House. The band stopped in front of the
hotel, and the musicians seized off their caps,
mopped their brows and looked around toward
Rankin furtively, thinking of beer. But Rankin,
again swinging his dangerous little bag, was making
a way through the crowd toward the wide door.
Garwood was almost lifted from his carriage, and
felt himself helplessly swept into the hotel office
on the great human breaker that rolled in that way.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>When his feet touched the floor again, the loud
cry went up:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speech! Speech!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin turned toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to give it to &rsquo;em, Jerry, &rsquo;fore they&rsquo;ll
let you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he led the way up the stairs toward the
parlor. Garwood went after him, with the mayor
and a self-appointed committee following, and
in another minute he had stepped out on the
balcony, and bared his head to the breeze that was
blowing warm off the prairie. As he stood there,
erect and calm, with the little wind loosening the
locks over his forehead, his lips compressed and
white, his right hand in the breast of his coat, after
the fashion of all our orators, many in the crowd
for the first time were conscious of how like a congressman
this young fellow really looked. They
began to celebrate the discovery by another cheer,
but Garwood drew his hand from the bosom of his
coat and raised it toward them. Instantly a warning
&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; ran through the whole concourse,
the few wagons rattling by halted suddenly, and a
hush fell. Garwood&rsquo;s eye swept the old familiar
square, his face flushed, his heart beat high, but
outwardly he was calm, as he affected the impressive
pause that adds so much to oratory. And then
he began with studied simplicity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that seemed
low, but which carried in the evening air across
the square, &ldquo;and fellow citizens: I am profoundly
touched by this welcome. Words are inadequate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>to express, fittingly, how much it means to me.
For thirty years I have gone in and out among
you, as a boy and as a man, and it has always
seemed to me that the highest honor I could
achieve in life would be found in your respect, your
confidence, if possible, your love. Your wishes
and your welfare have ever been my first and highest
thought. I know not what responsibilities may
await me in the future, but whether they be small
and light or great and heavy, still my wish and purpose
shall remain the same&mdash;to serve you, well and
faithfully; whatever they may be, I know that nothing
can ever bring to my heart the deep gratitude
or fill me with the sweet satisfaction this magnificent
welcome affords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not expect a speech from me this
evening. At a later day and at some more convenient
and appropriate season, I shall address you
upon the issues of the approaching campaign, but
I would not, even if I were physically able to do so,
intrude partisan considerations upon you in this
hour. But I can not let you go away without the
assurance that I am deeply sensible of the great
honor you do me. With a sincerity wholly unfeigned
I thank you for it. May God bless you
all, may you prosper in your basket and your store
and&mdash;&rdquo; the speaker&rsquo;s eye wandered far away to
the ragged edges of the crowd&mdash;&ldquo;thanking you
again and again, I bid you good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cheer promptly arose, and Garwood bowed
himself backward through the window. Rankin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>standing near him, laid his hand on the shoulder
of the mayor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; he said to that executive, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the hand-shaking and the congratulations
began again. Garwood stood there, at times passing
over his brow the handkerchief he held in his
left hand, while he gave to the men who passed by
him a right hand that was red and swollen and
beginning to ache. And outside, the crowd, feeling,
when its American passion for speech-making
was satisfied, that it had had its due, went away,
leaving the square deserted.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II">II</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE mother of the new candidate for Congress
in the Thirteenth District expressed her pride
in her son&rsquo;s achievement by cooking for him
that night, with her own hands, a supper of the
things he most liked to eat, and while the candidate
consumed the supper with a gusto that breathed
its ultimate sigh in the comfortable sense of repletion
with which he pushed back his chair, his appreciation
ended there, and half an hour later he
left his mother to the usual loneliness of her widowed
life. Sangamon Avenue, where the self-elected
better element of Grand Prairie had gathered to
enjoy the envy of the lower classes, stretched away
under its graceful shade-trees in aristocratic leisure.
The darkness of a summer evening rolled under
the elms and oaks, and blurred the outlines of the
tall chimneys and peaked roofs which a new architect
coming from the East had lately given to the
houses of the prosperous. Here and there a strip
of cool and open lawn, each blade of its carefully
mown blue-grass threading beads of dew, sparkled
in the white light of the arc lamps that hung at
the street crossings. On the wide verandas which
were shrouded in the common darkness, white
forms could be seen indistinctly, rocking back and
forth, and the murmur of voices could be heard,
in bland and desultory interchange of the banalities
<span class="pagenum2 hide" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>of village life. The avenue had been laid an
inch deep in mud by the garden hose, which might
have been seen in the last hours of the day, united
in a common effort to subdue the dust that puffed
in little white clouds as Grand Prairie&rsquo;s horses
stumbled along. Now and then some surrey, the
spokes of its wheels glistening in the electric light,
went squeaking leisurely by as some family solemnly
enjoyed its evening drive; now and then
some young man, his cigarette glowing into a
spark of life and then dying away, loitered down
town. The only other life was represented by the
myriads of insects feverishly rising and falling in
clouds about the arc lamps, or some silent bat describing
vast circles in the darkness, and at intervals
swinging into the light on membranous wings to
snatch her evening meal, bite by bite, from that
mass of strenuous, purposeless animal life.</p>

<p>As he strolled, slowly, for he wished to preserve
his collar intact until he should present himself
immaculate before the woman of his love, Garwood
felt some of the peace of the sleepy town
fall upon him. He gave himself up to the sensuous
effect of it, inhaling the odors of a summer night,
and when he turned into the yard of the Harkness
home his heart leaped. A filmy figure in white
slowly floated, as it seemed to his romantic vision,
out of the darkness that lay thick under the veranda.
Half way down the walk, under the oaks, they met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerome! I&rsquo;m so proud!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pride she had felt in him still glowed in her
eyes as they sat there in the wicker chairs, but now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>when she heard him sigh, she bent toward him,
and her voice filled with a woman&rsquo;s pity as she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired, aren&rsquo;t you&mdash;poor boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very tired,&rdquo; he assented, with a man&rsquo;s
readiness to be coddled. &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s rest just to be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laid his hand on hers and she drew closer,
looking eagerly into his face. She needed no
light other than the glow of the summer night to
make his features plain to her. She looked long
at him, and then she withdrew her hand, and sat
erect, smoothing her skirts with an affected primness
and folding her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you must tell me all about it,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;The newspapers are so unsatisfactory, and you
know I&rsquo;ve only had the one little note you wrote
me Wednesday night&mdash;when you thought you
were beaten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They laughed, now that they could do so with
impunity, at the danger he had been in so short a
time before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;it was a close shave, after
all. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Jim Rankin I&rsquo;d have come
home to-night beaten, and there wouldn&rsquo;t have
been any band or any carriage or any crowd to
greet me&mdash;as Rankin reminded me this afternoon
when I was near bursting at the reception I did
get.&rdquo; He laughed, but the laugh had a tinge of
bitterness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have been there,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d been beaten?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I missed you this afternoon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I looked
for you everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were enough there, weren&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not quite,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the crowd lacked one,
just one.&rdquo; He spoke with a little injury in his
tone. And the girl, with her quick apperception
of it, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted you all to myself, dear. I can give
you part of the time to the public&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t share
you.&rdquo; She said this in the pride of a new conception
of Garwood that had just come to her&mdash;a conception
of him as a public man, sacrificing himself
for the people. Garwood himself instantly shared
the conception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that better?&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>For answer he took her hand again, pressing it
in his big palm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now tell me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>So he told her the story of the Clinton convention;
how the delegations from the seven counties
that comprised the Thirteenth Congressional District,
his district, as he was already careful to speak
of it, had gone there and stubbornly balloted for
one, two, three days without a change or a break,
until a thousand ballots had been cast, and men
were worn and spent with the long-drawn agony of
those tense hours in the stifling opera house. He
felt a touch of the old fear that had come over him
when he heard on Thursday night that Tazewell
County would go to Sprague the next day, and it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>looked as if, the deadlock thus broken, Sprague
would be chosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;Sprague had his own
county, Moultrie, and Logan, and if he got Tazewell
it would mean thirty votes more&mdash;almost a
cinch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s attention flagged in her effort to penetrate
the mysteries of ballots and delegations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the night I wrote you,&rdquo; he went on,
and her interest brightened with her understanding.
&ldquo;I was mighty blue that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a pause, for the pity of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that was the night, too, when Jim Rankin
came to the front. I never knew him to rise to
such heights of political ability before. I tell you,
Emily, we must be good to Jim Rankin&mdash;he&rsquo;s the
best friend we&rsquo;ve got. He went out after supper,
and was out all the night. When he came in at
four o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;I had just thrown
myself on the bed in my clothes to snatch a wink
of sleep&mdash;he came into our room and said, &lsquo;Well,
Jerry, my boy, we&rsquo;ve got him skinned now&mdash;Piatt
will go to you on the first ballot to-morrow, and
McKimmon will swing Mason on the second&mdash;and
that&rsquo;ll settle it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood paused. She sat with her chin on her
hand. The lace of her sleeve fell back, exposing
her round forearm, white like marble in the moonlight
that was spilling through the purple shadows
of the trees and trickling on her dress. But a soberness
had clouded her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you suppose he did it, Jerome?&rdquo; she
asked presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Garwood answered, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s
more,&rdquo; he added with a dry little laugh, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s soberness deepened as the silence in
which she received his last words lengthened. Garwood
glanced at her in some concern, and then he
hurried on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it came out just as he said. The next
morning Piatt County threw her vote to me on
the first ballot, and by the time it got down to
Tazewell it was all over with Sprague; his man
Simp Lewis&mdash;you&rsquo;ve heard me speak of him&mdash;moved
to make it unanimous, and the noise
began.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed again, this time in sheer joy as he
lived those hours once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It lasted all morning, when we weren&rsquo;t making
speeches telling how we loved each other, and the
party, and the dear old flag; it lasted all the way
over here on the train, until I got home and saw
everybody but the one woman I&rsquo;d done it all for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you saw me in the crowd while you were
speaking from the hotel balcony, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scene in the square flashed back to him.
The sea of faces turned up to his, the halting vehicles,
the heads at windows, the raveling edges of
the common crowd&mdash;he saw it all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had never heard you make a speech before,
you know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and I had always wished
to&mdash;it was a splendid speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he mused, and strangely for him, seemed
not to have heard her praise, &ldquo;yes, I saw you&mdash;I
saw nothing but you. I thought of nothing but
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerome,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was happy and proud
that minute to think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he seized her, crushing her to him as
if in some sudden access of fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearest!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all this is nothing to me
beside you and your love. Do you really love me
so very much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know!&rdquo; he heard her whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will&mdash;always?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter what I did&mdash;or have done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you are&mdash;you. You are&mdash;mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; he persisted, somehow growing
fierce, &ldquo;sure&mdash;do you know what you are saying?
No matter what I did, how unworthy I became,
to what depths I sank&rdquo;&mdash;even in that instant he
was conscious of a dramatic quality in the situation,
conscious of the eloquence, as it seemed to
him, of his words&mdash;&ldquo;to what depths of shame, of
dishonor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;Jerome!&rdquo; the girl raised her face, half
frightened, &ldquo;what do you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he demanded, and he fairly shook
her, &ldquo;how do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her face, and he saw that it was moistened
with tears. She withdrew from his embrace,
and sat erect. He let his arms fall to his side.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>Then she took his face in her two hands, she
looked into his eyes, and she gave a scornful little
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ah, Jerome, because
I know you; because I know that you could
do nothing dishonorable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hung his head, helpless, and the impulse to
tell her passed with the moment that made it impossible.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, when he was going, as he
stood below her on the steps of the veranda, she
said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerome, do you know what Mr. Rankin did to
get those delegations to&mdash;swing to you, did you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure there was no&mdash;no&mdash;money?&rdquo; She
said the word as if she were afraid of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Money!&rdquo; and he
laughed the same laugh of protestation she had
laughed a while before, though he laughed the
big laugh of a man. &ldquo;Why, my precious little girl,
money would be the last thing in the world with
me&mdash;I guess it always will be!&rdquo; he observed in
rueful parenthesis. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe me when I
tell you that my law practice, and God knows it
was small enough as it was, has gone to pieces in
this campaign, that I&rsquo;m insolvent, that I&rsquo;m a pauper,
that I&rsquo;d have to be buried in the potter&rsquo;s field
if I were to die to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t! Jerome, please,&rdquo; she held her
hand to his lips to hush him, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk of dying!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>I&rsquo;m frightened to-night.&rdquo; She shuddered once
again into his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frightened?&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;What at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s foolish. I guess it&rsquo;s just
because I&rsquo;m so happy&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid of too much
happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could only fold her closely in his arms again.
He, too, was filled with a fear he dare not name.</p>

<p>It was late when Garwood walked homeward
under the maples that poured their thick shadows
along the sidewalks of Sangamon Avenue. The carriages
which in the early evening had squeaked leisurely
by in the sprinkled street had taken their occupants
home. The houses of Grand Prairie&rsquo;s aristocrats
were closed for the night and loomed now
dark and still. Here and there, on a dusky lawn,
he could see some counterfeit fountain, improvised
of the garden hose, left to run all night, tossing
its sparkling drops into the mellow light of the
moon. The only sounds beyond the tinkle of these
fountains were the sounds of a wide summer night,
the crickets, the katydids, far away the booming
of bullfrogs, farther away still the baying of some
lonesome dog. It was all peace without, the peace
of brooding night; but within, fear lay cold and
heavy on his heart; not alone the fear which, with
its remorse and regret, he had felt keen as knives
at his heart an hour before when the woman he
loved lay passive in his arms, but a new fear,
though born in the same brood. Under its stress,
his imagination tortured him with scenes in the
forthcoming campaign, black headlines in opposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>newspapers, a voice bawling a question at him
from the crowd he was addressing, until the cumulative
force of their disclosures should drive him
from the stump.</p>

<p>But presently he put forth his will. &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;
he said, almost aloud, &ldquo;how foolish! I am young,
I am strong, I have the love of the best woman on
earth; she would not believe if they told her! I
can win, and I will win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed aloud, because the street was still,
and the night was deep. He flung up his arms
and spread them wide, taking a long, deep breath
of the sweet air. &ldquo;I will win, win it all&mdash;her and
everything besides&mdash;Congress, Governor, the Senate&mdash;all!&rdquo;
He strode along erect and calm, full of
a vast faith in his own lusty powers, full of the
sublime confidence of youth.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>MILY HARKNESS might easily have been
the leader of what the local newspapers, imitating
those of Chicago, had recently begun
to call the &ldquo;Smart Set,&rdquo; a position which would have
entitled her to the distinction of being the most
popular girl in town, but because she did not accept
the position, she was perhaps the most unpopular
girl in town. &ldquo;Society,&rdquo; in Grand Prairie,
lacked too much in what is known as eligible
young men, for while the town produced the normal
quantity of that product, those who were
strong and ambitious went away to Chicago or St.
Louis where, in a day of economical tendencies
that were fast making the small towns of a more
prosperous past but a shaded and sleepy tradition,
there were larger fields for their young efforts.
Those that were left were employed in their
fathers&rsquo; businesses, and some of them worked in
the three banks of the town, but while these were
able, out of their scant salaries, to arrange for a
series of assembly balls in the dining-room of the
Cassell House every winter, they found calls upon
the girls, in whose parlors they would rock all
the evening, chaffing each other with personalities,
their nearest approach to the society life.</p>

<p>The social activities of the place were therefore
left largely to the initiative of the elder women, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>formed the usual number of clubs, held the usual
number of meetings, and derived, possibly, the
usual amount of benefit therefrom. These clubs
were inaugurated under a serious pretense of feeding
starved intellectualities, and were impregnated
at the first with a strong literary flavor, but in the
end they administered to a bodily rather than a
mental hunger, and their profound programs degenerated
into mere menus.</p>

<p>The men of Grand Prairie soon learned to identify
the days on which the club meetings fell by the
impaired appetites their wives showed at the supper
table, and the louder tones in which they talked all
the evening. Ultimately, when the euchre club had
evolved into the higher stage of the whist club, the
men became expert enough to tell, by the absence
of the vocal phenomenon already noted, the days
on which the card tournaments were held.</p>

<p>When Emily Harkness came home from the
Eastern college where she had taken a bachelor&rsquo;s
degree, it was thought that she would be a decided
acquisition to society, a fact that was duly exploited
in the Grand Prairie newspapers. The
young men of the town at once began to call, but
when they found that she did not enter into the
spirit of those little personalities which formed the
sinew of what they called their conversation, and
when they learned that she would not endure the
familiarity that the other girls of the town indulged
them in, they began one by one to fail in these well-meant
attentions. Several of them, out of a devotion
to the spirit of social duty, tried for a while to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>cultivate, or at the least to assume, a literary taste
that would admit them to her confidence. But their
reading had been limited to the Chicago Sunday
newspapers, the works of the Duchess and to the
most widely advertised novels of the swashbuckler
school, and they could only stare vacantly when
she soared into the rarer altitudes of the culture
she had acquired at college, where she had had
a course of Browning lectures and out of a superficial
tutoring in art had espoused with enthusiasm
the then prospering cause of Realism.</p>

<p>Failing in literature, a few of the more determined
of these youths essayed music, but when she played
for them Chopin&rsquo;s nocturnes and asked if they liked
Brahms, whose name they could never learn to pronounce,
they gave her up, and fled with relief to
the banjo, the mandolin, and the coon songs that
echoed not inharmoniously on summer nights
along the borders of Silver Lake, as they called
the muddy pond where the aquatic needs of Grand
Prairie society are appeased. Emily could not
follow them thither, for she would not consent to
buggy rides, even on moonlight nights. And so
the young men of Grand Prairie voted her &ldquo;stuck
up,&rdquo; and to themselves justified their verdict by the
fact that she made them by some silent spiritual
coercion call her Miss Harkness instead of Em,
or Emily at least.</p>

<p>As for the clubs, she continued to attend them
occasionally, for she was needed to prepare papers
on literary topics for the federated meetings held
monthly in the Presbyterian church. The matrons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>of the town would listen to her with the folds in
their chins multiplying as their faces lengthened
and their bodies yielded to the cushioned pews of
the warm tabernacle, but however conscientiously
they tried to follow her, their winks would develop
into nods, and they would fail asleep. At the conclusion
of her papers, of course, they gave Emily
their gloved hands in congratulation, but the gulf
between them yawned wider and wider, until Emily
became a mere intellectual rather than a human
personality.</p>

<p>Thus left to herself, Emily seemed to be doomed
to a life in which she would never have opportunity
for the development of her talents. She had
brought away from college many exalted purposes,
and she meant to keep these purposes high, but
at times she despaired of ever having the chance
to put her acquirements to what her father would
have called practical use. She read much, for she
had much leisure, and kept up at first a prodigious
correspondence, but gradually those friendships
which in the flush of exuberant youth had been
destined for immortality, declined and faded as
such things do fade in our lives, and soon ceased
altogether. She had tried writing, and sent two
or three manuscripts away to the magazines, but
they were returned so promptly that her jocular
father said the editors doubtless had an arrangement
with the postmaster to return all such suspicious-looking
parcels to the senders.</p>

<p>Then in that period which brought the customary
desire to earn her own money, she proposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>giving music lessons, but her father, in the
social pride he possessed, without any social inclinations,
at once vetoed the proposal.</p>

<p>It was in these changing, unquiet moods that
she met Garwood. She had found that about the
only practical outlet for the aspirations of women,
in her time and country, was in the direction of
charitable work. An unusually severe winter in
Grand Prairie had made many opportunities for
efforts of this nature, and she found a special pleasure
in going about in the poorer quarter which lay
beyond Railroad Avenue, hardly a block from the
respectable homes of the well-to-do. The pleasure
she derived from this new work was largely subjective;
perhaps, as it is likely to do, it ministered
to her spiritual vanity as much as to anything else.
In the end, her emotional appreciation of the picturesque
in poverty led her into indiscriminate
giving. This new phase of her development did
not increase her favor in the eyes of her neighbors.
They resented her activity as foolish and meddlesome;
the poor&mdash;to whom, in the delusion common
to all the thoughtless rich, they gladly attributed
unbounded good health&mdash;could get along all
right, they said, if they would only work and save
their money; or, as they preferred to express it,
be industrious and frugal.</p>

<p>One of the families Emily visited had been frugal
so long that it had lost the strength to be industrious.
It was a German family that had come
from the province of Pomerania, and the yellow
hair of the mother framed a face that Emily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>loved to picture in its girlish prettiness among
the fields of her native land and happier childhood.
Her husband was a man with a delicious
dialectal speech, and he could tell famous tales
of his service in the German army. He had
worked in the &ldquo;Boakeye Bre&rsquo;erie,&rdquo; as he called the
Buckeye Brewery, and for some reason that Emily
never properly grasped had lost his job. When
she discovered the family they were patiently living
on the remnant of a side of pork the man had
bought with his last money.</p>

<p>Emily had pictured herself meeting, in the course
of her charitable work, some interesting young
doctor, with a Van Dyck beard; but all the doctors
in Grand Prairie, like most of the other workers in
that depleted vineyard, were old men; she met
instead, what is universal, a young lawyer.</p>

<p>Jake Reinhardt, who never had money to buy
bread or meat, seemed always able to procure beer
and tobacco, an incongruity Emily could not understand
at first. She learned afterwards that Jake
knew a saloon-keeper who had a mixture of kind-heartedness
and long-headedness, the first of which
led him to trust Reinhardt for the beer and tobacco,
while the second justified the course because
Reinhardt&rsquo;s presence at his bar made one consumer
more when a round of drinks was ordered for the
house. Then, one day, suddenly, just as Emily
thought she was getting the family on its feet, Reinhardt
felled a man in the saloon with a blow of a
billiard cue, and was thrown into jail on a charge
of assault with intent to kill. His victim was lying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>in a precarious state; possibly he might die; Reinhardt
might yet be held to answer to a charge of
murder.</p>

<p>Emily found Mrs. Reinhardt with a face bloated
by tears, staring in mute anguish at this new calamity
she could not comprehend. As Emily&rsquo;s first
thought in the former difficulties had been a doctor,
now her first thought was a lawyer; but it
seemed that one had already appeared, and Mrs.
Reinhardt in her broken speech extolled him as
a ministering angel. It was plain that he had taken
up the cause out of pity for Reinhardt&rsquo;s defenseless
condition, perhaps in a belief in his moral innocence,
which the blundering police could not or
would not admit. As the affair turned out, Emily&rsquo;s
sympathies proved to have been as fully justified as
the young lawyer&rsquo;s, and what she then observed of
the practical administration of justice in criminal
courts only confirmed many of the sociological
heresies that then were sprouting in her mind,
quite as much, indeed, to her own distress as to her
father&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Emily gave Mrs. Reinhardt <i>carte blanche</i> in the
matter of spending money to clear her husband,
and even offered to pay the young lawyer&rsquo;s fee.
When he refused, the lofty heroism of his act, as
she called it, opened the way for a sympathy between
them, and by the time Garwood acquitted
his client, he and Emily were friends.</p>

<p>Garwood&rsquo;s social traditions were far removed
from those of Emily; and it was only in Railroad
Avenue, and never in Sangamon, that they could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>have met at all. Garwood had never gone into
society in Grand Prairie; his mother was a Methodist,
and to go into society it was necessary to
be an Episcopalian, or at least a Presbyterian. He
would have betrayed his training in any social
emergency and he had to hide his ignorance of conventionalities
behind a native diffidence, which in
a young man of his solemnity happily passed for
dignity.</p>

<p>But he came into Emily&rsquo;s life at the very time
when it was ready to receive impressions from
a more masterful mind. In his young dream of
a career, in that enthusiasm for humanity which
springs in most men of the liberal professions with
the shock of their first impact with a hard, material
age, and develops until the age taints them with
its sordidness, Garwood had enlisted in the world-old
fight for equality and democracy. His first victory
was for himself, and he was elected to the
Legislature. Thereafter, he dreamed of becoming
some day a great commoner, and so was in danger
of turning out a demagogue.</p>

<p>While he had not read as widely as Emily he
had thought a great deal more, and the two young
persons were delighted as they discovered new
points at which, to their own satisfaction, they supplemented
each other perfectly. Emily found in
Garwood the only worthy intellectuality that the
youth of Grand Prairie offered, and though, after
a certain intimacy had been established by his first
few awkward calls, he showed as much contempt
as ever for the more aristocratic environment of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>girl, this only flattered her, and she noted with the
feminine pride and pleasure in little conquests, that
as he grew accustomed to the life his constraint
gave way to a liking for its luxury.</p>

<p>She adopted him, with a young girl&rsquo;s love of a
protg; gave him books to read and was pleased
rather than displeased at the gossip their relations
excited before that first winter ended and the spring
took from them the excuse their charitable work had
given for being much in each other&rsquo;s society.
Thereafter they frankly dispensed with this bond
and substituted one of affection pure and simple.
This propinquity naturally ended in love, and the
club women of the town were doubtless justified in
their new and keenly relished understanding that
Emily had more than the mere patroness&rsquo;s interest
in the career of this young man. Most of them said
she was demeaning herself, but that only added to
their joy.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="IV">IV</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ANKIN was not only chairman of the Polk
County central committee, a position he had
held for years, but he was also chairman of
the congressional committee. It was, therefore, with
an authority no one cared to question that, early in
September, he engaged two rooms in the Lawrence
Block for the county committee&rsquo;s headquarters,
though he preferred to pitch his own in Garwood&rsquo;s
law office, which was on the same floor.
Then he swung a banner across the street and began
to menace Garwood&rsquo;s opponent with challenges
for joint debates. To Grand Prairie this
expressed the formal opening of the campaign, but
Garwood already had been two weeks away from
home, speaking twice daily in Piatt and DeWitt
Counties, under the skies in the afternoon, under
the stars by night, and had returned for a day before
going down into Moultrie. The office had
been crowded all day and it was late in the afternoon
before he had a chance to write the letters
that needed his attention. He had just dismissed,
rather ungraciously, a delegation of negroes&mdash;for
Rankin never had any patience with negro delegations&mdash;and
had begun dictating to the typewriter,
when another caller came demanding a personal interview.</p>

<p>The caller was a little man, who walked with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>stooped shoulders, swung a slender stick energetically
as he advanced, and continued to twist it
nervously when he had come. His head was but
thinly covered with lank, moist hair, as was shown
when he pushed back the sun-burned straw hat he
wore. This moisture seemed to be general in his
whole system. It was apparent in the perspiring
hand he gave to Garwood; it affected the short
mustache, dyed a dull, lifeless black, at which he
scratched with a black-edged finger nail as he
talked, when he was not plucking at the few hairs
that strayed on his chin. This moisture showed
again in his blue eyes, from which it had almost
washed the color. After he had been shut in the
room with Garwood for half an hour, the air was
laden with alcoholic fumes, which, exuding from
his whole body, may have accounted for his moist
personality. While he talked he chewed and puffed
a glossy yellow cigar.</p>

<p>This man was Freeman H. Pusey, and he was
publisher, editor, reporter, all in one, of the Grand
Prairie <i>Evening News</i>. His journal was a small one
of four pages, for the most part given over to boiler-plate
matter, but it carried a column of &ldquo;locals,&rdquo;
a portentous editorial page, and took on a happy,
almost gala expression whenever it could exploit,
under the heavy ragged type in which its headlines
were set, some scandal that would shock Grand
Prairie. In politics the <i>News</i> claimed to be independent,
which meant that it leaned far to one side
in one campaign, and as far to the other in the next;
indeed, it sometimes held these two extreme positions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>in the same campaign, and found no difficulty
in vindicating its policy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to see you, Mr. Garwood, in regard to a
little political matter,&rdquo; Pusey began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Garwood, not too cordially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you know that the <i>News</i> is the accepted
organ of the people, that is, the great mass
of the common people here in Grand Prairie and,&mdash;ah&mdash;I
might say in Polk County.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; said Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus far, you may have noticed, we have been
neutral, that is, I should say, independent, as between
you and Judge Bromley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood was looking out of his window down
into the court house square, where the winds
played with the rubbish that always litters the
streets of Grand Prairie. He made no reply, and
Pusey eyed him out of his swimming little eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Pusey, pinching his chin, &ldquo;we
have waited to see how events would shape themselves
before&mdash;ah&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood grunted, and Pusey went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;ah&mdash;I had come to the conclusion that
perhaps our best course would be to support you,
inasmuch as you&rsquo;re our fellow townsman&mdash;and it
occurred to me that perhaps a write-up would do
you some good, that is, with the great mass of the
common people, the laboring people generally, you
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be obliged to you, of course,&rdquo; said Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-m-m, yes,&rdquo; answered Pusey, &ldquo;I presume so.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>But&mdash;if I&mdash;that is, we, were to give you such a
write-up and run your cut, you would, I presume,
be ready to take twenty or thirty thousand copies
for distribution?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would it cost?&rdquo; said Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;at two cents a copy&mdash;you can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Garwood, &ldquo;for your support you
would expect about five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not put it in that light,&rdquo; said Pusey, spitting,
and trying to assume a dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can see, of course, Mr. Garwood&mdash;a man
of your experience can readily see, that a paper like
the <i>News</i> can hardly afford to give up its valuable
space to that which is not strictly news matter without
some hope of compensation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Garwood, &ldquo;but to be frank with you,
Pusey,&rdquo; he turned and looked straight into the little
man&rsquo;s watery eyes, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford it. This campaign,
into which I sometimes wish I hadn&rsquo;t gone,
has proved expensive, and my practice has suffered,
so that I need all the money at my command for
more immediate and pressing expenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not consider this immediate and pressing
then?&rdquo; said Pusey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; Garwood replied. &ldquo;Would
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pusey was silent for a while. When he spoke he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are certain passages in your life, Mr. Garwood,
which just now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood glared at Pusey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the game, is it?&rdquo; he said. His tone
was low, for he was calculating carefully the part
he had to play.</p>

<p>The little man was revolving his straw hat on
the head of his stick, and he wore a grin about his
moist mouth. Garwood had mastered his anger,
but Pusey had to wait some time before he spoke.
Presently he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Pusey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know Jim
Rankin is running my campaign, and I have promised
him not to take any steps without consulting
him. We&rsquo;ve had all sorts of callers here, white and
black, cranks, mind readers, palmists, faith curists
and men with votes in their vest pockets, and I&rsquo;ve
adopted the rule of turning over to him every one
who comes. I&rsquo;ll speak to him about your case, and
you may call around to-morrow and see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Pusey had gone, Garwood burst upon
Rankin, his face white with anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The damned little blackmailing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;n hell&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Rankin, letting
his feet fall from the desk.</p>

<p>Garwood, digging his clenched fists into his
trousers&rsquo; pockets, paced the floor, swearing angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Free Pusey&rsquo;s been here,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d he want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;but what for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For keeping still, what&rsquo;d you suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he know anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood paused by the window, still breathing
hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;he claims to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin drew himself upright with the difficulty
of a fat man, and leaned towards Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Legislature?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Garwood gave an impatient fling of his head.
He turned then, drew a chair up to the desk, and
sat down, facing Rankin. But Rankin spoke first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some more of that newspaper rot &rsquo;bout the
Ford bill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Garwood wearily. &ldquo;I
reckon I&rsquo;ll never hear the last of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Rankin said, &ldquo;to hell with it. Let
him print it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But damn it,&rdquo; Garwood went on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s serious
with me&mdash;just now&mdash;at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, cheer up,&rdquo; said Rankin, &ldquo;that won&rsquo;t cut any
figure with you&mdash;it won&rsquo;t lose a vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but it may lose me something else&mdash;&rdquo; Garwood
spoke with a significance that Rankin could
not instantly appreciate. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Garwood
continued &ldquo;there was nothing in it, but then&mdash;you
know, a woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big fellow vented a little whistle, and then
kept his lips puckered up to aid his thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; said Garwood, who could
not then, in such a mood, endure the delay of silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rankin, &ldquo;let me think, I can&rsquo;t
straighten it out all at once. It &rsquo;as al&rsquo;ays hard
fer me to mix politics and business, or politics and
religion, or politics and&mdash;&rdquo; He was a sentimental
man who feared to show his sentiment, and he did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>not speak the tender word of many meanings. But
under the influence of the twilight, perhaps because
they could not see each other&rsquo;s face, they talked
confidentially, until the gloom of evening was expanding
in the room. Then Rankin took out his
watch and tried to read its dial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I must be gettin&rsquo; home&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
try to fix it up somehow, Jerry. Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;just
leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think we ought to do it, Jim,&rdquo; Garwood
said, &ldquo;I might borrow the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a red cent for that pirate!&rdquo; exclaimed Rankin,
smiting the desk with his fist. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need
all the money we can get in the campaign. Besides,
he ain&rsquo;t honest enough to stay bought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though Rankin had told him not to worry, Garwood
was depressed and troubled, and longed for
sympathy. In the evening, when he found time to
go to Emily, Pusey was uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired, of course,&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;and how
hoarse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the speaking, I reckon,&rdquo; said Garwood. &ldquo;I
campaigned all week with old General Stager; we
spoke outdoors to acres of people. How those old-timers
stand it I don&rsquo;t know. They can blow like
steam whistles day and night. When I left the old
gentleman last night at Mt. Pulaski, he was as fresh
as a daisy&mdash;said he liked a little taste of the stump
now and then&mdash;but that, of course, it wasn&rsquo;t anything
to what it used to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily laughed a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have some meetings indoors?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, after while&mdash;but we have to get the crowds
where we can find them, and the farmers are all
at the county fairs nowadays. I&rsquo;ll be glad when
it&rsquo;s over. The strain is pulling me down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you well?&rdquo; she asked with a woman&rsquo;s
constant concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, well enough; of course I have a cold
all the time, a candidate has to have that, and a
sore throat, but you have to smile, and look pleasant,
and shake hands, and be careful what you say.
I&rsquo;d give anything to be a free man once more, to
be able to talk without weighing every word, without
having to watch it as if I were drawing an indictment.
I&rsquo;d give anything to indulge one good
fit of anger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you&mdash;just get mad at me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood laughed fondly. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s good to come here and relax and speak my
mind. I did get mad to-day though, and threaten
to throw a man out of my office window.&rdquo; His
thought would revert to that subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; she asked, in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that little Free Pusey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted me to give him money for his support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t blame you. I can understand your
righteous indignation, Jerome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood felt the blood tinge his checks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t talk that way, Emily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you don&rsquo;t know how sordid politics are&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>is&mdash;which is it? I&rsquo;d probably have given it to
him, only I didn&rsquo;t have it; the righteously indignant
was the only attitude left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear you talk like that, Jerome.
I don&rsquo;t like to see you in that cynical mood. It
wasn&rsquo;t an attitude, it was your real nature speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, a man must keep his real nature in subjection
in politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, Jerome; you mustn&rsquo;t keep your
real nature in subjection in politics. We need just
such men as you in our public life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were silent then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerome,&rdquo; the girl said later, &ldquo;do you really need
money so badly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it costs, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak to father&mdash;I know he&rsquo;d
be glad to help you. He is very anxious to see
you succeed, you know&mdash;or if you think that Mr.
Pusey can harm you, why can&rsquo;t you let father speak
to him? Father once did him some favor&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you remember those sickening, fulsome articles he
wrote?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood gasped at the thought of Emily&rsquo;s father
penetrating that situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never that!&rdquo; he said, bringing his fist down on
his knee. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever suggest such a thing,
Emily, do you hear?&rdquo; He turned and his eyes
glowed as he looked at her. The girl laughed a
little laugh of pride in him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Jerome,&rdquo; she began in a playful way,
&ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t understand politics very well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>yourself.&rdquo; And then she became serious, and
sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how noble you are! And how high minded!
And how I love you for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat there a long while after that, in the
darkness. But they did not talk politics any more.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the Alton&rsquo;s early train drew out of
the Canal Street station that morning, the
last coach had its curtains drawn, with a
touch of royal mystery. Though its polished panels
were grimed from a long journey, though its roof
lay deep in cinders, and though its gilt lettering was
tarnished, still, as it moved onward with heavy dignity,
it was plainly no ordinary car, for it rolled majestically
at the end of that long train like some ship,
to which clung the sentimental interest of a stormy
voyage. As it passed, yardmen in blue overalls
straightened their backs painfully and scrutinized
it with professional eye, sometimes they swung
their caps; laborers, men and women, on their
morning way to work, halted by the crossing-gates
and united in a cheer, their futile little celebration
being dissipated by the clamor of the alarm bells,
as the train whirled by in its cloud of dust, and the
gates lifted to let the flood-tide of city life set in
again for the day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>The fireman in the engine cab sat erect as he
clanged his brass bell; the engineer, knitting his
brow as he studied his watch, stretched his hand
to the throttle with a touch as delicate as a telegrapher&rsquo;s.
Within the train, the division superintendent
whispered to the conductor. Plainly, it
was no ordinary car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>It was bearing a candidate for the presidency,
on his way west, swinging around the circle, as our
phrase has been ever since Andrew Johnson made
the first presidential stumping tour.</p>

<p>His itinerary had been so arranged as to give
him an hour in Lincoln that afternoon. General
Stager was to be there also and to speak before the
presidential candidate arrived. The old wheel-horse&rsquo;s
part was to hold the crowd, and he was well
cast, for he could talk on indefinitely, and yet round
off his speech with an eloquent peroration at any
moment and seem never to suffer any ill effects,
either as to himself or to his speech. Then in the
evening Garwood was to speak. He had looked
forward to the day with eagerness, anticipating
fondly his meeting with the great man who, as General
Stager would put it, was running for the highest
office within the gift of the American people.</p>

<p>He had gone up to Chicago with Rankin the
night before, and when the private car was
switched over from the Pennsylvania in the morning,
they boarded it with one or two members of
the state executive committee, and the member
of the national committee for Illinois.</p>

<p>The great man slept late, as great men may,
yielding to the conceit that their labors are heavier
than those of common men, and as Garwood and
Rankin sat in the forward compartment and whispered
to each other, Rankin noted his impression
by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old man takes it easy, don&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something of this impatience was expressed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>the cries of the crowd that gathered in the station
at Joliet, after the train had rolled by the high stone
walls of the penitentiary, and Garwood, growing
more accustomed to his position, allowed himself
to enjoy, as he saw men peering curiously in at
him, the distinction a man feels in riding in a
private car.</p>

<p>But the day was fully awake now, and the national
excitement that for a week had found its
dynamic center in that car, began to impress itself
upon its occupants; the newspaper correspondents
who traveled with the candidate began to make
notes now and then after they had learned the name
of the town they were passing; while jacketed
darkies began to slip about in their morning work,
and at last the candidate himself came into the
salon, clean and fresh, blinking his eyes in the sun,
as he smiled in a courtly way and said, as if they
were members of his suite traveling with a king:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he looked about him as if he had lost
something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the colonel up yet?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>His secretary at that instant appeared, pursued
by a black porter whisking at his blue clothes with
a long, thin broom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there you are. Did you rest
well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fairly,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;Papers come yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the candidate could reply, the chairman
of the state central committee had taken Garwood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>by the sleeve and drawn him up before the candidate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Garwood, our candidate for Congress
in the Thirteenth District.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Garwood,&rdquo; the great man said, &ldquo;very
glad to meet you, I&rsquo;m sure. You had rather a
spirited contest in your district, did you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood smiled at the memory of it. He was
about to reply when the colonel, who had gone for
the train boy, returned with a bundle of newspapers
that smelt pleasantly of the printer&rsquo;s ink, and gave
them all, save the one he had opened for himself,
to the candidate. The candidate took them in his
delicate hands, lifted his glasses, opened one of
the papers, and as he did so observed, his eyes running
up and down the columns:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such contests are always healthful indications, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood hemmed and murmured a disappointed
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The great man was slowly sinking into a
wicker chair, and beginning to read the reports of
the speeches he had delivered through Indiana and
Ohio the day before.</p>

<p>The whole party had got newspapers of the news
agent and had settled down to read them. The
newspaper men had bought with as much avidity
as the rest, and were trembling with the mingled
pain and pleasure of reading their own stuff, as,
with a contempt perhaps not all pretended, they
called it.</p>

<p>The news that the candidate had risen spread
through the train by some mysterious agency, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>almost before he had finished his breakfast, men
began to venture back that way to see him. He received
them all with his weary smile, shook their
hands, and thanked them for whatever it was he
seemed to think or wished them to think they were
doing for him. It was the better dressed of the
passengers in the forward coaches that were bold
enough to enter a private car at first, but as the
habit grew common, men from the day coaches,
and at last the farmers from the smoking car who
had got on to ride short distances between stations,
began to shamble back. One of them, with
his clothes and hat and whiskers all sun-burned to
a neutral shade of brown, stood in an awkward
attitude before the candidate crushing his white
slender hand in his own harsh palm, and pumped
it up and down, stammering through his tobacco
that he had been voting the straight ticket for fifty
years, and when the great man said he hoped that
he would live to vote it for fifty years more, the
little knot of admiring men laughed with exuberant
mirth at the joke.</p>

<p>As the news that the candidate had risen spread
through the train, so it sped onward before the
train, and now as they reached and impatiently
halted at little towns along the road, people were
gathered at the stations, stretching their necks, and
hastily glancing at all the windows of the train to
catch a glimpse of the man who might soon be their
president.</p>

<p>At each stop the candidate stepped out upon
the platform, his stenographer following him with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>note book, spoke a few words of greeting, and
dropped a politic remark that had the epigrammatic
ring of a political axiom.</p>

<p>Garwood was disappointed in not being called
on to speak himself, and he had been disappointed,
too, in not having the conversation with his
great leader he had anticipated. He was beginning
to realize the relativity of things, whereby a candidate
for Congress is only great when he is drinking
with a candidate for supervisor at some country
bar, but when he is riding in a private car with a
candidate for president he is small indeed, so small
that he is not noticed in the press despatches, as
Garwood was to learn when he faithfully read all
the city papers the next day.</p>

<p>But down below Bloomington the great man
gladdened him by taking a seat beside him, and
beginning to ask questions, which is sometimes the
mark of a great man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see, you reside in Grand Prairie, do you
not, Mr. Garwood? What is the condition of our
party over there just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood told him it was very good; he thought
there was much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The great man said that he had discovered such
conditions to be generally indicated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be only necessary to crystallize that enthusiasm
in the ballot box,&rdquo; he continued, with his
Latin derivatives, &ldquo;for us to win a splendid victory.
Your organization is satisfactory, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Garwood answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; the great man said. &ldquo;How large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>a town is Lincoln&mdash;we stop there this afternoon,
do we not, Colonel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel, too, said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agricultural community principally, I suppose?
Are the farmers fairly prosperous in the county?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Garwood, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve had good
crops this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see, General Bancroft used to represent
your district in Congress, did he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;some years ago. He&rsquo;s dead now,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember&mdash;I must&mdash;let me see&mdash;I was
in the forty-third Congress with him, was I not,
Colonel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The forty-fourth,&rdquo; corrected the colonel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, the forty-fourth. He was a very
fine man. I formed a very high opinion of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was a fine man,&rdquo; said Garwood. &ldquo;I read
law in his office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you, indeed? He was a very good lawyer,
as I recall him. We sat on the judiciary committee
together. Did he have a good practice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, the best at the Grand Prairie bar. He
was the best jury lawyer we ever had there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was a good speaker. Was the breach
in the party created by his peculiarly strong character
healed at his death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s pretty much healed now; for a long
time it bothered us, but we never hear of it any
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty popular with the people, was he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would presume so.&rdquo; The great man closed
his eyes as if shutting in some impression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Garwood went on, &ldquo;the bare mention of
his name will set them wild even now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed,&rdquo; said the candidate. &ldquo;He raised a
regiment about there, did he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the old ninety-third&mdash;the Bloody Ninety-third
they called it. A number of his old soldiers
will be at your meeting this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The candidate reflected that most communities
like to think that their regiments have been known
as &ldquo;the Bloody,&rdquo; but he did not say so to Garwood.</p>

<p>The train sped on, then Garwood heard it stop,
heard the cheers and cries of the crowds outside,
heard the rich voice of the candidate speaking, heard
the restless bell as the train moved on again with
quickly accelerated speed, while the little station
and the crowd and the two shining tracks dissolved
into one disappearing point of the perspective far
behind. The cheers faded away, and he tried to
imagine the sensation of the man for whom all this
outcry was being made. The great man seemed
to take it coolly enough. Either such things had
grown common to him, or he had trained himself
by a long course of public life to appear as if they
had, for when he was not making speeches on the
rear platform, or shaking hands with little delegations
that boarded the train to go to the Lincoln
meeting, he was resting in his stateroom. He was
not well, Garwood heard the colonel explain to
some one, and had to conserve his energies, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>like some athlete in training he seemed able to rest
and sleep between his exertions.</p>

<p>Rankin had wearied of the formalities of the
private car and, as the train began to fill with
familiar forms, men with whom he had battled in
conventions for years, he had fled to the easier
society and the denser atmosphere of the smoking
car, greeting countless friends from all over the
district, and doing the campaign work Garwood
felt he should be doing himself. But the magnetism
of his great leader, the joy of being in a
presence all men were courting in those days, perhaps,
too, a desire to feel to the utmost the distinction
of riding in a private car, kept him there.</p>

<p>The train had reached Atlanta Hill, and now its
noise subsided. The engine no longer vomited black
masses of smoke, but seemed to hold its breath
as, with wheels that spun so swiftly they seemed
motionless, it coasted silently and swiftly down that
steep grade. The spires and roofs of little Lawndale
showed an instant above the trees, and then
out on the level again the train sped on toward
Lincoln.</p>

<p>Garwood arose and got the overcoat he carried
to draw on after each speech, for its moral impressiveness
as much as to keep him from catching
cold, and as the engine began to puff heavily, and
the train rolled into Lincoln, Rankin appeared, hot
and perspiring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said to Garwood, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re there.
The boys have all been askin&rsquo; fer you!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they?&rdquo; asked Garwood, half guiltily.
&ldquo;What did you tell them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told &rsquo;em you was back here closeted with the
old man; that he wouldn&rsquo;t let you out of his sight,
that&rsquo;s what I told &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They heard the strains of a marching band, and
then a cheer arose.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="VI">VI</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE crowd began its cheering as the engine
slid on past the weather-beaten station and
stopped, puffing importantly as if it knew how
big a load it had hauled. And then the candidate appeared,
and midway in a cheer the crowd ceased,
stricken into silence by the sight of him. He stood
for an instant, pale and distinguished, a smile on his
cleanly chiseled face, an impersonal smile, almost
the smile of a child, as if he were unaccustomed to
all about him, crowd, committees, even the steps
of the railway carriage, for three men helped him
down these as if he could not know how such
things were done and might injure himself. Looking
carefully to his right and to his left, still with
that impersonal smile on his face, the candidate set
his patent leather boots to the splintered platform,
and then sighing &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; looked around over the
crowd.</p>

<p>It was all confusion where they stood, but Rankin
was already beside the candidate, calling him &ldquo;Mr.
President&rdquo; as he introduced to him promiscuously
men who had pressed forward grinning in a not
altogether hopeless embarrassment. All this time
the chairman of the Logan County committee was
fluttering about, striving to recall the orderly
scheme of arrangement he had devised for the occasion.
He had written it all out on a slip of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>paper the night before, having the carriages numbered,
and, in a bracket set against each number,
the names of those who were to ride in that carriage,
just as he had seen the thing done at a
funeral. But now he found that he had left his
slip of paper at home, and he found that he had
forgotten the arrangement as well, just as a man
in the cold hour of delivery forgets a speech he
has written out and burdened his memory with.
As the chairman turned this way and that, several
of his townsmen noticing the indecision and perplexity
written on his face, with the pitiless American
sense of humor, mockingly proposed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for McBain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the crowd gave the cheers, the chairman became
redder than ever and entreated the driver of
the first carriage to come closer. The driver drew
his horses, whose tails he had been crimping for
two weeks, nearer the curb, and then the chairman
turned toward the candidate and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way, Mr. President!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The candidate had been standing there smiling
and giving both his hands to men and women and
children that closed upon him, and as the chairman
looked toward him he saw Garwood standing by
his side. The chairman had forgotten Garwood.
In fact he had not expected him until evening, and
he had no place for him in his scheme. Rankin
saw McBain&rsquo;s predicament and promptly assuming
an official relation to the affair, gently urged their
presidential candidate toward the waiting carriage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>Before the candidate would move, however, he
looked about and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the colonel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the small man in the modish blue clothes
appeared from behind him, and the candidate sighed
as if in relief. They all helped him into the carriage,
and he smiled his gratitude. The colonel climbed
into the front seat facing his chief. Then another
traveling companion of the candidate, a man who
was slated for a cabinet position, followed him.
Garwood seemed about to withdraw and had raised
his hand to lift his hat, when Rankin said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get right in, Mr. Garwood, there&rsquo;s plenty of
room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood felt called upon to demur, knowing that
no place had been reserved for him, but Rankin
began to shove from behind, and Garwood found
himself sitting in the same carriage with the presidential
candidate. The chairman, who had expected
to ride with the great guest himself, scanned
the line of carriages drawn up for the others in the
party, and then slamming the door shut on them,
said to the driver:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Billy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The drums rolled again, and the band began to
play. The captains of the marching clubs shouted
their military orders, and the carriage moved. The
crowd cheered, and the candidate turning, became
suddenly grave. His pale face flushed slightly as
with an easy, distinguished air he lifted his high
hat.</p>

<p>Garwood saw that Rankin had secured a seat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>in one of the carriages farther back in the line,
and that half a dozen newspaper men, whom the
local chairman had failed to take into account, were
standing, with bored, insouciant expressions, waiting
to be assigned to vehicles, realizing that the
affair depended, for all beyond a mere local success,
upon their presence. At the last minute they
were crowded into a hack in which some of the
local leaders of the party had hoped to display
their importance before their neighbors. The slight
seemed a little thing at the time, but it eventually
created a factional fight in that county. The local
chairman himself was compelled to mount beside
the driver of one of the vehicles.</p>

<p>Amid a crash of brass, the throb of drums, and a
great roar from human throats the procession
wound up the crowded street. All the way the
sidewalks were lined with people, and all the way
the candidate lifted his high hat with that distinguished
gesture.</p>

<p>The whole county had come in from the country,
and farmers&rsquo; muddy wagons were hitched to
every rack, their owners clinging to the bridles
of horses that reared and plunged as the bands
went by. One township had sent a club of mounted
farmers, who wore big hats and rode horses on
whose hides were imprinted the marks of harness,
and whose caparisons were of all descriptions from
the yellow pelts of sheep to Mexican saddles, denoting
a terrible scouring of the township before
daylight that morning. These men were stern
and fierce and formed a sort of rude cavalry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>escort for the great man whom they cheered so
hoarsely. The procession did not go directly to
the court house, for that was only two blocks
away, but made a slow and jolting progress along
those streets that were decorated for the occasion.
There were flags and bunting everywhere
and numerous pictures of the candidate himself,
of varying degrees of likeness to him, and pictures,
too, of his &ldquo;running mate,&rdquo; the candidate for vice-president,
who at that minute was enjoying a similar
ovation in some far off Eastern village. Some
of the householders, galled by the bitterness of
partisanship, flaunted in their windows pictures of
the candidate&rsquo;s rival, but the great man lifted his
hat and bowed to them, clustered in silence before
their residences, as impartially as he did to those
of his own party.</p>

<p>In the last two blocks before the procession
reached the court house square they could hear a
man speaking, and Garwood knew that the voice
was the voice of General Stager. The old court
house standing in its ancient dignity in a park of
oak trees, lifting its plastered columns with a suggestion
of the calm of classic beauty, broke on their
sight, and the music of the bands, as they brayed
into the square, filled the whole area with their
triumphant strains and cheer on cheer leaped toward
them. The music and the cheers drowned
the voice of General Stager, and his audience suddenly
left him and surged toward the approaching
procession. The cheering was continuous, the
candidate&rsquo;s white head was bare most of the time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>and when the carriage stopped and he was assisted
up the steps into the speaker&rsquo;s stand, the bands
exultantly played &ldquo;Union Forever, Hurrah, Boys,
Hurrah!&rdquo; the horns fairly singing the words of the
song.</p>

<p>General Stager, red and drenched with perspiration,
advanced to shake the hand of the presidential
candidate, and the spectacle set the crowd yelling
again. The candidate began his speech immediately.
It was the same speech he had delivered
all along his itinerary, though his allusions to the
splendid agricultural community in which he found
himself, the good crops that had been yielded to
the hand of the husbandman, gave a fictitious local
color, and his touching reference to his old friend,
General Bancroft, by whose side he had sat at
Washington through so many stirring years fraught
with deeds and occasions of such vast import to
the national life, and his glowing tribute to the
Bloody Ninety-third, brought the applause rolling
up to him in great waves. He spoke for nearly
an hour, standing at the railing with the big flag
hanging down before him and a big, white water
pitcher standing close beside; behind him were the
vice-presidents sitting with studied gravity; near
by, the reporters writing hurriedly; before him and
around him, under the green and motionless trees,
a vast multitude, heads many of them bared, faces
upturned, with brows knit to aid in concentration,
jaws working as they chewed on their eternal tobacco.</p>

<p>Out at the edges of the crowd, a continual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>movement shifted the masses and groups of men,
along the curb were lines of wagons, with horses
stamping and switching their tails, across the street
on the three-storied brick blocks, the flutter of flags
and bunting. The old court house, frowning somehow
with the majesty of the law, formed a stately,
solemn background for it all; overhead was the
sky, piling rapidly now with clouds. The whole
square gave an effect of strange stillness, even with
the voice of the speaker ringing through it; the
crowd was silent, treasuring his words for future
repetition, treasuring perhaps the sight of him, the
sensation of being in his actual presence, for the
tale of future years.</p>

<p>But suddenly, in a second, when the crowd was
held in the magic spell of his oratory, when men
were least thinking of such a thing, he ceased to
talk, the speech was over, the event was closed,
and the great man, not pausing even long enough
to let the vice-presidents of the meeting shake
hands with him, or to hear the Lincoln Glee Club
sing a campaign song, looked about for the colonel,
climbed out of the stand into his carriage and was
whirled away, lifting his hat, still with that distinguished
air, amid cheers that would not let the
campaign song begin, and with little boys swarming
like outrunners at his glistening wheels.</p>

<p>When the meeting was over, Garwood went to
the hotel to wait for Rankin, who had a mysterious,
but always purposeful way of disappearing at times
of such political excitement as had been rocking
Lincoln all that day. Garwood had long since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>learned, when Rankin thus went under the political
waters, to await calmly his reappearance at the
surface, and so he wrote Rankin&rsquo;s name and his
own name on the blotted register of the hotel, and
asked for a room. He had scarcely laid down the
corroded pen the landlord found in a drawer, when
a voice beside him said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see it yet, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood turned to look in the grinning face of
Julius Vogt, who had come over with the Grand
Prairie &ldquo;excursion&rdquo; that morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; asked Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Vogt, drawing something from his
pocket, &ldquo;Pusey&rsquo;s article about you&mdash;there,&rdquo; and he
opened the copy of the <i>News</i> and gave it to Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Garwood, &ldquo;<i>that!</i>&mdash;I saw part of it.&rdquo;
And he smiled on Vogt, whom he felt like striking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Vogt, still grinning, though his grin
was losing something, &ldquo;I jus&rsquo; thought, maybe,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Garwood. Several others of the
Grand Prairie boys, as any one, considering them
in their political capacity, would have called them,
had drawn near, attracted by their candidate for
Congress, whose wide hat rode above all the heads
in the crowd. Doubtless they expected Garwood
to open the paper, but he was too good a politician
for that. As he stood there he idly picked at
the ragged edges of the sheets, and when he spoke
seemed to have forgotten it, for he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;d you like the speech?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; said Billy Feek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; said Doris Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he lam into &rsquo;em?&rdquo; said Burr Rippleman.</p>

<p>Still their eyes were on the paper which Garwood
seemed to be in danger of picking to pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was as fine an effort as I ever heard under
such circumstances,&rdquo; said Garwood. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
great campaigner.&rdquo; He carelessly thrust the paper
into the side pocket of the black alpaca coat he
wore. The boys were sober faced again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; back with us to-night, Jerry?&rdquo; said Elam
Kirk. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to hold the train till after your
speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reckon not,&rdquo; Garwood replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over
to Pekin in the morning.&rdquo; He looked at his watch.
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nearly supper time, and
I haven&rsquo;t given a thought to what I&rsquo;m going to
say to-night. Will you come have a little drink
before supper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys grinned again, saying they didn&rsquo;t care
if they did, and followed Garwood towards the
dingy bar-room, making old jokes about drinking,
in the manner of the small town, the citizens of
which, because of their stricter moral environment,
or perhaps of more officious neighbors, can never
indulge in tippling with the freedom of city-bred
fellows. Garwood could not escape without a
joke at his expense, attempted by some one of the
party whose appreciation of hospitality was not refined,
and though it made him shudder he had to
join in the laugh it provoked. But when he could
get away from them at last, he went to the room
he had taken, and there, seated on the edge of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>bed, he opened the paper and held it in the window
to catch the fading light. It had been issued at
noon that day, and given an added importance by
the word &ldquo;Extra!&rdquo; printed in black and urgent
type at the head of its page. But below, Garwood
read another word, a word that needed no bold
type to make it black&mdash;&ldquo;Boodler!&rdquo;&mdash;and then&mdash;his
own name.</p>

<p>Pusey had adroitly chosen that day as the one
most likely to aid the effect of his sensation, and
the opposing committee had gladly undertaken to
circulate hundreds of copies at the Lincoln rally.
The article was obviously done by Pusey himself,
and he had taken a keen delight in the work. He
had written it in the strain of one who performs
a painful public duty, the strain in which a judge,
gladdened more and more by his own utterance,
sentences a convicted criminal, though without the
apology a judge always makes to the subject of
his discourse, in carefully differentiating his official
duty from his individual inclination.</p>

<p>Garwood forced himself remorselessly to read it
through, to the very end, and then abstractedly,
sitting there in the fading light that straggled in
from the dirty street outside, he picked the paper
into little pieces, and sprinkled them on the floor.
The letters of the headline were printed on his
mind, and as he sat there in the darkness and
viewed the litter he had made, seeing it all as the
ruin of his life and hopes, he flung his great body
headlong on the bed and buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>Half an hour later Rankin thrust his head in at
the door and called into the darkness that filled
the room:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He haltingly entered, piercing the gloom, and
dimly outlining the long form of his candidate
stretched on the frail bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerry! Jerry!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Garwood&rsquo;s form was tall when it stood erect in
the daylight, it was immense when it lay prone
in the dark. There was something in the sight to
strike a kind of superstitious terror to the heart,
and Rankin&rsquo;s elemental nature sensed something
of this, but when Garwood heaved and gave a
very human grunt, Rankin cried in an approach to
anger:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, git up out o&rsquo; that! Don&rsquo;t you hear the band
tunin&rsquo; up outside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd in town had been gradually decreasing
all through the waning afternoon; the multitude
that had come to hear a candidate for the
presidency would not stay to listen to a candidate
for Congress. With the falling of the night there
had been a gathering of gray clouds, and at the
threatening of a storm the crowd thinned more
and more. Gradually the weary ones withdrew,
the howls of tipsy countrymen on the sides of the
square subsided, the rural cavalry galloped out of
town with parting yells for their candidate, the
square in the falling rain glistened under the electric
light that bathed the ancient pediment of the
court house with a modern radiance. At nine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>o&rsquo;clock Garwood finished his speech, ceremoniously
thanking and bidding good night a little mass
of men who huddled with loyal partisanship around
the band-stand, with a few extinguished torches
reeking under his nose, with the running colors of
the flags and bunting staining the pine boards on
which he rested his hands, and with a few boys
chasing each other with sharp cries about the edges
of the gathering.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>THAN HARKNESS, having finished his labors,
such as the labors of a bank president
are, sat at his old walnut desk in the window
of the First National Bank waiting for Emily to
come and drive him home. The old man had set
his desk in order, with his big gold pen laid in the
rack of his ink stand, his blotters held down by a
paper weight, and a leaf of his calendar torn off,
ready for the next day&rsquo;s business. The desk was in
such order as would have made the work-table of a
professional man unfamiliar to him, but, as he waited,
Ethan Harkness rearranged it again and again,
absent-mindedly, changing the position of the blotters,
wiping his pen once more on his gray hair.
Then he drew out his gold watch, adjusted his
spectacles, took an observation of the time, and
looked with an air of incredibility into the street.
Any break in the routine of his life was a pain
to Ethan Harkness, and it was with a resignation
to this pain that he called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morton, bring me the paper! I might as well
read it if I&rsquo;ve got to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old teller, a white haired, servile man with
the stoop of a clerk in his shoulders, and the disindividualized
stare of a clerk in his submissive
eyes, came shuffling in with the paper he himself
had been reading. Harkness took it reluctantly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>His life was as methodical as his calendar, and if
he read the evening paper before supper he would
have nothing to do after, for he could not go to bed
till nine o&rsquo;clock. If he did, he awoke too soon in
the morning and then he would reach the bank
before the mail had been delivered. Thus it will
be imagined how serious would be the train of consequences
set in motion by one irregularity in his
day.</p>

<p>But he took the paper. It was the <i>News</i>, and
his eye lighted at once on the article that Pusey had
written about Garwood. As he read it a great rage
gathered in his breast, a rage compounded of many
emotions, which gradually took form, first as a
hatred of Garwood for his misdeeds, then of Pusey
for laying them bare. Ethan Harkness was not a
man of broad sympathies. What love he had was
bestowed on Emily; he had lavished it there ever
since his wife had died. He gave so much to her
that he had none left for others, and he stood in
the community as a hard, just man who had built
up his fortune by long years of labor and self-denial
that made him impatient of the frailties which his
fellows in the little community, in common with
their brothers in the wider world, found it so hard
to govern and restrain.</p>

<p>He sat there mute and implacable, with his fist,
still big from the farm work it had done in early
life, clenched upon the <i>News</i>, while Morton
clanked the bars of the vault in fastening the place
of treasure for the night, and slipped here and
there behind his wire cage, pretending little duties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>to keep him from facing his employer when in such
a mood.</p>

<p>It was after five o&rsquo;clock when the surrey lurched
into the filthy gutter, and when Harkness saw that
Emily was not in it, he felt his rage with Garwood
increase for depriving him thus of the pleasant
hour to which he looked forward all the afternoon.
He rode home in silence behind old Jasper who
tried in his companionable way, by making his
characteristic observations on men and things, to
draw his master out of his moody preoccupation.</p>

<p>Harkness found his daughter at the supper table,
and when he saw her, he at once yearned toward
her with a great wish to give her such comfort as
a mother would have supplied; but with something
of his own stern nature, she held herself spiritually
aloof; and he ate his cold meat, his fried potatoes,
his peaches and cream and drank his tea without a
word from her, beyond some allusions to the heat
of the sultry day, the prospect of rain, and the need
of it at his farm lying at the edge of town. Her
face was white, but her eyes were not red or swollen,
and she gave him no sign whether or not she
knew of the blow that had been struck at the man
she loved. He thought several times of telling her,
or asking her about it, but he was always half afraid
of her, and had submitted to her rule all the years
when no one else was strong enough to rule him.</p>

<p>When supper was done, she disappeared, and as
he strained his ears from his library where he was
reading all alone, he heard her close a door upstairs
and lock it. Later, when he went up in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>stocking-feet, having left his boots downstairs in
the habit he had brought out of the poverty of his
boyhood into the comfort of his age, he paused a
moment by her door, and raised his hand as if to
knock; but he could not figure it out, he said to
himself, and so changed his mind and went to bed,
leaving it all to time.</p>

<p>When Emily went to her room, she sat at her
dressing-table a moment looking at her own reflection,
until her features became so strange that
a fear of insanity haunted her, and then she half
undressed and lay down upon her bed. She told
herself that she could not sleep that night, and yet,
after her first burst of tears she fell into the sound
and natural slumber of grief-stricken youth with
its vague apologetic hope that the whitened hair
will show in the morning.</p>

<p>Far in the night she awoke with a strange ignorance
of time and place. She shivered with the
chill of the night air. Rain was falling and she
heard the lace curtains at the windows scraping
in the wind against the heavy leaves of a fern
she was nurturing, and with a woman&rsquo;s intuitive
dread of the damage rain may do when windows
are open, she arose to close them. The cool air
swept in upon her, driving the fine mist of the rain,
but she let it spray a moment upon her face, upon
her breast, before she pulled her window down.
Outside the yard lay in blackness, and she looked
down on it long enough to distinguish all its familiar
objects, each bush and shrub and tree; she
saw the lawn mower stranded by the walk and she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>thought how her father would scold old Jasper in
the morning; and then she thought it strange and
unreal that she could think of such irrelevant
things at such a time. Yet every material thing
was aggressively normal; the electric light swinging
and creaking at the corner of Ohio Street with
the rain slanting across the ovoid of light that
clung around it showed that; everything the same&mdash;yet
all changed with her.</p>

<p>She turned from her window. The darkness indoors
was kind, it seemed to hide the wound that
had been dealt her, and she hastily undressed and
got to bed, curling up like a little child. Then she
lay and tried to think, until her head ached. She
had been thinking thus ever since the cruel moment
that afternoon when she had picked up the
<i>News</i> on the veranda.</p>

<p>Her heart had been light that day. She had
thought of Jerome as he traveled in his private
car with a coming president. She had gone with
him to Lincoln, and seen him riding through the
crowded streets; had beheld him in the flare of
torches, his face alight with the inspiration of an
orator, his eyes fine and sparkling, as she had so
often seen them blazing with another passion; had
heard his ringing voice, and the cheers of the frantic
people, massed in that remembered square. And
so in the afternoon she became impatient for the
cry the boy gave when he tossed the local papers
on the floor of the veranda. She had swooped
down on them before the boy had turned his little
back and mounted his wheel. And the thing that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>first struck her eye had smitten her heart still&mdash;the
headlines bearing Garwood&rsquo;s name. She had
caught at the newel post in the wide hall to keep
from falling.</p>

<p>It had not then occurred to her to doubt the
truth of the tale Pusey had told. She had not yet
progressed in politics or in life far enough to learn
to take with the necessary grain of salt everything
a newspaper prints. The very fact that a statement
was in type impressed her as abundant proof
of its truth, as it does children, young and old, a
fact which has prolonged the life of many fables for
centuries and will make others immortal. It seemed
to her simply an inexorable thing and she turned
this way and that in a vain effort to adjust the
heavy load so that it might more easily be borne.
But when she found it becoming intolerable, she
began to seek some way of escaping it. In that
hour of the night she first doubted its truth; her
heart leaped, she gave a half-smothered laugh.
Then she willed that it be not true, she determined
that it must not be true, and with a child-like trust
in His omnipotence, she prayed to God to make it
untrue. And so she fell asleep at last.</p>

<p>All these hours of the night, in a far humbler
street of the town, in a small frame house where
nothing could be heard but the ticking of an old
brown Seth Thomas clock, a woman lay sleeping.
Her scant, white hair was parted on her wrinkled
brow, her long hands, hardened by the years of
work, were folded on her breast, and her face, dark
and seamed as it was, wore a peaceful smile, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>she had fallen asleep thinking of her boy, laughing
at his traducers, and praying, pronouncing the
words in earnest whispers that could have been
heard far back in the kitchen which she had set in
such shining order, that her boy&rsquo;s enemies might
be forgiven, because they knew not what they did.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Rankin came home from the Lincoln
mass meeting, he seemed to have reached
that stage in the evolution of his campaign
when it was necessary to put forth mighty claims
of victory. He declared that he had never had any
doubt of ultimate success at the polls, though he
admitted, with a vast wave of his arms to embody
the whole magnanimity of his concession, that he
had felt somewhat disturbed by that apathy which
was the result of over-confidence. But the meeting
at Lincoln, he said, had completely dispelled these
fears. He said that the meeting at Lincoln had been
a great outpouring of the common people, and that
they had gone home so deeply enthusiastic, after the
sight of their great leader, that it was now only a
question of majorities. And as for Garwood, why,
he had never been so proud of the boy in his life.
The visit of the presidential candidate would increase
the normal majority of twenty-two hundred
in the Thirteenth District to three thousand, but
Garwood was bound to run at least five hundred
ahead of the ticket. Rankin had published these
views extensively as he sat in the smoking car of
the excursion train that jolted over from Lincoln
the night of the big meeting. The Grand Prairie
boys had been disturbed by the story printed in the
<i>News</i> but Rankin laughed at their fears, just as he
had laughed at Garwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;ll do him good!&rdquo; Rankin declared,
bringing his palm down on the knee of Joe Kerr,
the secretary of the Polk County central committee.
&ldquo;Do him good, I tell you. It&rsquo;s worth a thousand
votes to us in Polk alone to have that little
cur spring his blackmailin&rsquo; scheme at this stage o&rsquo;
the campaign. It&rsquo;s as good as a certificate of moral
character from the county court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s a blackmailin&rsquo; scheme?&rdquo; asked
Kerr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think it!&rdquo; cried Rankin, &ldquo;why, damn it, man, I
know it&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you hear how Jerry threw him out
of his office the day he tried to hold him up? Why,
he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; killed him if I hadn&rsquo;t held him back. You&rsquo;d
ought to post up on the political history of your
own times, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men who were perched on the arms and
hanging over the backs of the car seats, pitching
dangerously with the lurches the train gave in the
agony of a bonded indebtedness that pointed to an
early receivership, laughed above the groanings of
the trucks beneath them. They had gathered there
for the delight it always gave them to hear Jim
Rankin talk, a delight that Rankin shared with
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you kill him, Jim?&rdquo; one of them
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said with an affectation of modesty as
he dropped his eyes and with his hand made moral
protest, &ldquo;I wanted him to print his story first. I&rsquo;ll
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>have to kill him some day, but I reckon I won&rsquo;t
have time before election.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Rankin was extravagant in talk, he calculated
pretty accurately the effect of his words,
and never said many things, in a political way at
least, that came back to plague him. His conception
of Pusey&rsquo;s motives was eagerly accepted by his
own party men, and they went home with a new
passion for work in the wards and townships.</p>

<p>Pusey meanwhile had been standing on street
corners in Grand Prairie, swinging his cane, and
glancing out with a shifty eye from under his yellow
straw hat, but men avoided him or when they
spoke to him, did so with a pleasantry that was
wholly feigned and always overdone, because they
feared to antagonize him. Rankin had not seen him
since the publication of his screed, but one evening,
going into the Cassell House, he saw the soiled
little editor leaning against the counter of the cigar
stand. The big man strode up to him, and his red
face and neck grew redder, as he seized Pusey by
the collar of his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You little snake!&rdquo; Rankin cried, so that all the
men in the lobby crowded eagerly forward in the
pleasant excitement the prospect of a fight still stirs
in the bosoms of men. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a notion to pull
your head off, and spat it up ag&rsquo;inst that wall there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave the little man a shake that jolted his
straw hat down to his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just dare to print another line about us
and you&rsquo;ll settle with <i>me</i>, you hear? I&rsquo;ll pull your
head off&mdash;no, I&rsquo;ll <i>pinch</i> it off, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>
<p>Rankin, failing of words to express his contempt,
let go Pusey&rsquo;s coat and filliped directly under his
nose as if he were shooting a marble. Pusey glared
at him, with hatred in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him, Jim,&rdquo; one of the men in the
crowd pleaded. They all laughed, and Pusey&rsquo;s eye
grew greener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t kill you this evenin&rsquo;,&rdquo; relented
Rankin, throwing to the floor the cigar he had half
smoked, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to embarrass the devil
at a busy time like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chicago papers had not covered the Garwood
story, as the newspaper phrase is, though the
Grand Prairie correspondents had gladly wired it
to them. But the <i>Advertiser</i> as well as one or two
other newspapers in the Thirteenth District, which
were opposed politically to Garwood, had not been
able to resist the temptation to have a fling at him
on its account, though with cautious reservations
born more of a financial than a moral solvency.</p>

<p>The <i>Evening News</i> with all the undiminished
relish Pusey could find in any morsel of scandal,
had continued to display its story day after day
with what it boasted were additional details, but
on the day following the incident in the Cassell
House, Pusey left off abusing Garwood to abuse
Rankin, and smarting under Rankin&rsquo;s public humiliation
of him, injected into his attack all the
venom of his little nature. He kept, however, out
of Rankin&rsquo;s way, and all the while the big fellow
as he read the articles chuckled until his fat sides
shook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Jim Rankin was the most popular man in Grand
Prairie; men loved to boast for him that he had
more friends than any three men in Polk County,
and the sympathy that came for Garwood out of a
natural reaction from so much abuse, was increased
to sworn fealty when Rankin was made the target
for Pusey&rsquo;s poisoned shafts. When the story first
appeared the men of Grand Prairie had gossiped
about it with the smiling toleration men have for
such things, but now it was a common thing to
hear them declare that they would vote for Garwood
just to show Free Pusey that his opinions
did not go for much in that community.</p>

<p>Emily Harkness did not leave the house for
days. She felt that she could not bear to go down
town, where every one would see her; and there was
nowhere else to go, save out into the country, and
there no one who lives in the country ever thinks of
going unless he has to go.</p>

<p>She had entrenched herself behind the idea
that the story was untrue, and she daily fortified
this position as her only possible defense from
despair, seeking escape from her reflections when
they became too aggressive by adding to her interest
in Garwood&rsquo;s campaign. She knew how
much his election meant to him in every way, and
though she preferred to dissociate herself from
the idea of its effect on her own destiny, she quickly
went to the politician&rsquo;s standpoint of viewing it
now as a necessary vindication, as if its result by
the divine force of a popular majority could disprove
the assertions of Garwood&rsquo;s little enemy.</p>

<p>Emily read all the papers breathlessly dreading
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>a repetition of the story, but her heart grew lighter
as she found no further reference to it. She had
ordered the boy to stop delivering the <i>News</i>, and
she enjoyed a woman&rsquo;s sense of revenge in this
action, believing that it would in some way cripple
Pusey&rsquo;s fortunes. She resolved, too, that her
friends should cease to take the sheet, but she could
not bring herself to make the first active step in
this crusade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she had watched for an indignant
denial from Garwood himself, and she thought it
strange that none appeared. But finally, striving
to recall all she knew of men&rsquo;s strange notions of
honor, and slowly marking out a course proper for
one in Garwood&rsquo;s situation to pursue, she came to
the belief that he was right in not dignifying the
attack by his notice. She derived a deeper satisfaction
when the thought burst upon her one day,
making her clasp her hands and lift them to her
chin with a gasp of joy such as she had not known
for days, that the same high notion had kept him
from writing to her, though her conception of a
lover&rsquo;s duty in correspondence was the common
one, that is, that he should write, if only a line,
every day. But Garwood was busy, she knew, with
his speaking engagements in Tazewell and Mason
Counties, and she tried faithfully to follow him on
the little itinerary he had drawn up for her, awaiting
his coming home in the calm faith that he
would set it all aright.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE strong-limbed girl who went striding up
the walk to the Harkness&rsquo;s porch was the
only intimate of her own sex that Emily had
retained; perhaps she retained her because Dade
Emerson was away from Grand Prairie so much
that custom could not stale this friendship. The
girls had been reared side by side, they had gone
to the same school and, later, for a while, to the
same college; and they had glowed over those
secret passions of their young girlhood, just as they
had wept when their lengthened petticoats compelled
them to give up paper dolls.</p>

<p>Dade Emerson, however, had never shared
Emily&rsquo;s love of study; she conformed more readily
to the athletic type at that time coming into vogue.
In the second year of Dade&rsquo;s college course, old
Mr. Emerson died, and his widow, under the self-deluding
plea that her grief could find solace only
in other climes, resolved to spend in traveling the
money with which her husband&rsquo;s death had dowered
her. Dade Emerson entered upon the hotel
life of the wanderer with an enthusiasm her black
gowns could hardly conceal. They tried the south
for her mother&rsquo;s asthma, and the north for her hay-fever;
they journeyed to California for the good
the climate was sure to do her lungs, and they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>crossed the Atlantic to take the baths at Wiesbaden
for her rheumatism.</p>

<p>While her mother devoted herself to a querulous
celebration of her complaints, Dade led what is
known as the active outdoor life. She learned to
row, and to swim; she won a medal by her tennis
playing, and she developed a romping health that
showed in the sparkle of her dark eye, in the flush
of her brown cheek, in the swing of her full arm
or the beautiful play of the muscles in her strong
shoulders as she strode in her free and graceful
way along the street or across the room. She
climbed Mont Blanc; she wished to try the Matterhorn,
but the grave secretary of the Alpine Club
denied her permission when she dragged her
breathless mother one summer up to Zermatt to try
for this distinction.</p>

<p>In the summer under notice, her mother had
declared that she must see Grand Prairie once
more before she died, and they had come home,
and thrown open the old house for its first occupancy
in two years. When the Emersons arrived
at Grand Prairie, Dade had embraced Emily fervidly,
and the two girls had vowed that their old
intimacy must immediately be restablished on its
ancient footing. With her objective interest in life,
Dade had no difficulty in giving her demeanor towards
Emily the spontaneity it is sometimes necessary
to feign towards the friends of a by-gone day
and stage of development; and so she swung into
the wide hall, and fairly grappled Emily, who had
come to meet her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bean just dying to see you, dyah,&rdquo; she said,
in the new accent she had acquired while in Europe,
which was half Eastern, half English.</p>

<p>She kissed Emily, and flung herself into a chair
in the parlor whither Emily was already pointing
the way. Her fresh, wholesome personality, her
summer garments, the very atmosphere of strength
and health she breathed were welcome stimulants
to Emily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s downright hot, I say,&rdquo; Dade continued,
wriggling until her skirts fluffed out all over the
front of her chair, and showed the plaid hose above
the low, broad-heeled shoes she wore. She glanced
around to see if the windows were open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beastly!&rdquo; she ejaculated. And she took a handkerchief
and polished her face until its clean tanned
skin shone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; she went on, tossing her handkerchief
into her lap, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sleep a wink thinking about
you lahst night. I had to run ovah to see you
about it directly I could leave poor mamma. Isn&rsquo;t
it too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of you to come, dear,&rdquo; Emily
got in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been intending to have you over to
take dinner and spend the day. But now that you
are back for good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back for good!&rdquo; said Dade, &ldquo;<i>Mais non</i>, not a
bit of it. Mamma says she cawn&rsquo;t enduah this
climate, and who could? We&rsquo;re off directly we can
decide wheah to go. She wants to go up into the
White Mountains, but I&rsquo;ve just got to go some
place wheah they have golf links, don&rsquo;t you know?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>The truth is, Em, its impossible in this stupid, provincial
old hole&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be every bit as fat as mamma
if I stay hyah a minute longah&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You miss your exercise?&rdquo; said Emily, lolling
back on the cushions of her divan in an indolence
of manner that told how remote exercise was from
her wish at that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak the word!&rdquo; cried Dade, pushing
out one of her strong hands repellently. &ldquo;I positively
cawn&rsquo;t find a thing to do. I tried for a cross-country
walk yesterday, and got chased by a stupid
fahmah, and nearly hooked by a cow&mdash;to say nothing
of this rich Illinois mud. Mamma owns a few
hundred acres of it, <i>Dieu merci</i>, so we don&rsquo;t have
to live hyah on it, though if the&mdash;what do you say?&mdash;<i>les
paysans</i>&mdash;keep on crying for a decrease in
rent I fawncy you&rsquo;ll see me back hyah actually digging
in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The picture of the Emerson&rsquo;s tenants which
Dade drew struck a pang in Emily&rsquo;s sociological
conscience. She pitied the girl more for her inability
to estimate the evils of a system which left
her free to wander over the earth seeking that exercise
which her clamoring muscles demanded,
while those upon whose labors she lived had to
exercise more than their overwrought muscles required
than she did for the remote prospect of her
being doomed to labor on the corn lands of Polk
County.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go down to Zimmerman&rsquo;s saloon and bowl,
if it wouldn&rsquo;t shock you all to death. But tell me,
how do you feel about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;About what&mdash;your need of exercise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, no&mdash;about the terrible <i>expos</i> of
that interesting protg of yours? <i>On ne pourrait
le croire&mdash;c&rsquo;est affreux!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; Emily said, with a woeful laugh, &ldquo;if
I understand your French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;I thought you were
so deeply interested in him. Haven&rsquo;t you worked
hard to give him some sort of social form, getting
him to dawnces and all that sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not to dances, Dade. He doesn&rsquo;t dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, to be suah. I heahd that&mdash;and I heahd&mdash;&rdquo;
she gave a ringing laugh&mdash;&ldquo;I heahd that he was
downright jealous when you went to visit Sallie
Van Stohn in St. Louis and dawnced with all those
men theah. And I didn&rsquo;t blame him&mdash;those St.
Louis men are raeally lovely dawncers, bettah than
the Chicago men&mdash;they have the <i>mesure</i> but not
the <i>grce</i>&mdash;though the St. Louis men are nothing
at all to the German officers we met at Berlin.
Why, my dyah, those fellows can waltz across a
ball room with a glass of wine on each hand&mdash;raeally!&rdquo;
She stretched out her well-turned arms
and held their pink palms up, to picture the corseted
terpsichorean. &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you teach him
to dawnce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily did not conceal with her little laugh the
blush that came at this reminder of her attempts
to overcome Garwood&rsquo;s pride, which had rebelled
at the indignity of displaying his lack of grace in
efforts at the waltz or the easier two-step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How stupid! But that&rsquo;s nothing now to this
othah thing. Had you evah dreamed of such a
thing? I thought from what you wrote me that
he was the soul of honah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he is!&rdquo; declared Emily, lifting eyes that
blazed a defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t it injure his chawnces of election?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Emily fairly cried in her determined opposition
to the thought, &ldquo;no, it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She sat
upright on the divan, and leaned toward her friend
with a little gasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you think it true,
Dade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dade ceased to rock. She looked at Emily with
her black eyes sparkling through their long lashes,
and then she squeezed her wrists between her
knees and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emily Harkness, you&rsquo;re in love with that man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily&rsquo;s gaze fell. She thrust out her lower lip
a little, and gave an almost imperceptible toss
to her brown head. She stroked a silken pillow
at her side. Dade&rsquo;s eyes continued to sparkle at
her through their long lashes, and she felt the
conviction of their gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said at last, gently, &ldquo;I am going to
marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dade continued to gaze a moment longer, and
then she swooped over to the divan. She hugged
Emily in her strong young arms, almost squeezing
the breath from the girl&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless you, I knew it!&rdquo; And then she kissed
her, but suddenly held her away at arm&rsquo;s length
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>as if she were a child, and said with the note of
reproach that her claim as a life-long intimate
gave her voice: &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the first I&rsquo;ve told except papa,&rdquo; said
Emily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est vrai?</i>&rdquo; said Dade, her jealousy appeased.
&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all right, dyah&mdash;and it&rsquo;s splendid, I
think. He&rsquo;s a typical American, you know, and
the very man you ought to marry. Mamma&rsquo;s been
afraid I&rsquo;d marry one of those foreignehs, and so
have I&mdash;but it&rsquo;s splendid. And I tell you&mdash;&rdquo; she
settled herself for confidences&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back
from anywheah to the wedding, to be your maid of
honah&mdash;just as we used to plan&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know?
Oh, I am so glad, and I think it&rsquo;s noble in you;
it&rsquo;s just like you. It&rsquo;ll elect him, too, if you announce
it right away. I say, I&rsquo;ll give a luncheon
for you, and we can announce it then&mdash;no, that
wouldn&rsquo;t be correct, would it? We&rsquo;d have to have
the luncheon hyah&mdash;but it&rsquo;ll elect him. It would
in England, where the women go in for politics
more than you do, <i>n&rsquo;est ce pas</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She always spoke of her own land from the detached
standpoint a long residence abroad, and
sometimes a short one, gives to expatriates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;let&rsquo;s plan it all out now, dyah. Will you
have it at St. Louis, and Doctah Storey?&mdash;why&mdash;there&mdash;there
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily had pillowed her head on Dade&rsquo;s full
bosom, and her long-restrained tears had flooded
forth. The larger girl, with the motherly instinct
that comes with brimming health, wrapped her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>friend in her arms, and soothed her, though disengaging
one hand now and then to wipe the perspiration
that bedewed her own brow. The two
girls sat there in silence, rocking back and forth
among the pillows in the darkened parlor, until
Dade suddenly broke the spell by sitting bolt upright
and exclaiming:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, there comes that big De Freese
girl. I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she rose to effect her incontinent desertion
at once. Turning in from the street, a large, tranquil
blonde, gowned and gloved and bearing a
chiffon parasol to keep the sun from her milky
complexion, was calmly and coolly crossing the
yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got call in her eye!&rdquo; exclaimed Dade.
And then she hurried on, before she fled, to say all
she had left unsaid:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ovah this aftahnoon, and we&rsquo;ll plan it all
out&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to make mamma spend next
wintah in Washington. It&rsquo;ll help some of her diseases&mdash;what&rsquo;s
the climate of Washington good for,
do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Emily had risen to glance out the window,
and then, with her hands to her face, had fled from
the room. Dade heard the patter of her feet on
the stairs as she gathered up her skirts and soared
aloft. And then in her surprise she looked out
the window again and saw a tall man, with a
broad black hat slouched over his eyes, taking
long steps across the lawn. He seemed boorishly
to be set on beating the mild blonde to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>The two callers gained the veranda at the same
moment, before the bell could be rung to summon
the maid. As she left the parlor Dade snatched
her hat from her head and sent it sailing across to
the divan, and then, at the door, she smiled and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good mohning, Miss de Freese. Miss Hawkness?
No, she&rsquo;s ill, and isn&rsquo;t visible this mohning.
I&rsquo;m staying with heh. She&rsquo;ll be downright
sorry&mdash;and Mr. Hawkness, sir,&rdquo; she turned to Garwood,
&ldquo;left wohd to have you wait. He&rsquo;ll be hyah
directly. Just step into the drawing-room please,&rdquo;
she smiled, but with a little scowl, at the obtuse
politician, who seemed disposed to dispute with
her, though under the influence of her eyes, he
obeyed, and when he had passed in, she continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad, Miss de Freese, raeally&mdash;and
you&rsquo;ve had such a walk this wahm mohning. Oh,
nothing serious at all, just one of heh headaches,
you know; I&rsquo;ll tell heh&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be awfully disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pahdon, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I left my hat.&rdquo; And
she crossed to the divan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I understand you to say that Emil&mdash;that
Miss Harkness was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell heh; she&rsquo;ll come right down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said Mister Harkness had left&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dade smiled the superior smile of the socially
perfect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You possibly misundahstood me, sir; I said
Miss Harkness would be down.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>She bowed herself out of the room, leaving Garwood
with one more perplexity added to those
that were already accumulating too rapidly for
him.</p>

<p>Dade went up the staircase and to Emily&rsquo;s room.
The girl was standing by her door, her hands
clasped and raised in expectation to her freshly
powdered face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Le voil!</i>&rdquo; said Dade, pointing tragically over
the balusters, and then she went down the back
stairs.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ARWOOD, as he sat in the cool drawing-room
that morning, rehearsed again, and, as
he suddenly remembered, for the last time,
the scene he was about to enact with Emily. He
had thought the matter all out, and with his quick
perception of the theatrical quality of any situation,
he had prepared for it just as he would for a public
speech or, when he had the time, for an argument
before a jury. As he sat this morning, taking his
eye for a moment from the hall door to glance
through the open window into the yard, he beheld
old Jasper raking the lawn, heard him talking to
himself in an expostulatory tone, and knew that the
old man was just putting the finishing touches to
some imaginary opponent he had vanquished in an
argument. And Garwood smiled, and felt a sympathy
with the old fellow; he, too, was given to the
practice of talking to himself; if the speeches he
delivered when walking home at night could only
be reproduced on the stump, he would have no
fears whatever of the result.</p>

<p>As he looked out the window he became telepathically
aware of a presence, and turned to behold
Emily standing in the wide door that led into
the hall, parting the heavy curtains with trembling
hands. He sprang to his feet and took a step towards
her. She advanced to meet him, she stretched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>out her hands, she took him by the arms; she turned
him half around that the light might fall full in his
face, and then she let her eyes melt into his. And
before he could move, or say one word of all he had
intended to say, her face gladdened like the sky at
dawn, and she smiled and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jerome&mdash;I knew it, I knew it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then she hid herself against his breast, and
he put his arms about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever believe it for one little instant?&rdquo;
he whispered, bending over her, after he had drunk
to the uttermost the ecstasy and the anguish of
that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for one little instant,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Oh,
not for one little instant! I knew it couldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Garwood, looking over the masses of her
hair, again saw old Jasper working away in the
yard. He was singing now, and Garwood knew
that ever after in his memory the aged negro would
live in association with that scene.</p>

<p>When they were sitting on the divan, side by
side, and the morning was gone, Emily asked him,
out of the half-affected simplicity Garwood loved
to have her adopt, as most men do, because of
the tribute to their superior intelligence it implies:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerome, what is a roorback?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, and then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A roorback, dear, is a lie told because of the
necessities of politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are lies necessary in politics?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always, it seems,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span> MAN whose figure had taken on the full
contour of a prosperous maturity sat at his
desk, reflectively drawing little geometrical
designs on a pad of paper. The abundance of his
prosperousness was indicated in every appointment
of his law offices no less than in his own person,
for they reflected the modern metropolitan style of
Chicago rather than the fashion of an older day in
central Illinois, where a bare floor, a flat table, and
a rough set of bookshelves bearing up Blackstone
and Kent, Chitty and Starkie, and the Illinois digests
and reports, were considered sufficient furnishing.
His silvery hair was cropped close with a
half bang over his clear forehead, and his gray beard
was as carefully trimmed as his hair; in the lapel
of the gray coat that set his shoulders off stoutly,
was a red carnation. He wore a fresh carnation
every day; where he got them was ever a mystery
to the people of Clinton.</p>

<p>Judge Bromley had resigned from the bench of
the Circuit Court to become the general attorney
of a railroad than ran up out of Egypt to tap the
central portion of Illinois, and he was the local
attorney for a number of other roads. His railroads
would have been pleased to have him in Congress,
no doubt, though they would have preferred
to have him on the bench of the United States
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>Court. And it was with this prospect in veiled
view that he had consented to run for Congress in
a district where the normal majority was greatly
against him, knowing that his sacrifices would commend
him to the administration at Washington in
case the national ticket of his party was successful.</p>

<p>Another man sat with Bromley in his private
office that October morning. He sat tentatively,
if not timidly, on the edge of his chair, for the conversation
had not reached such a stage of confidential
warmth on the lawyer&rsquo;s part as warranted
the man in lounging at more familiar ease in its
leather depths.</p>

<p>The man was McFarlane, and he was the chairman
of the congressional committee of the party
that had nominated Bromley to stand in the Thirteenth
against Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already sent my checks to the chairman
of each county committee in payment of my assessments,
Mr. McFarlane,&rdquo; the lawyer said at
length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know that, Judge,&rdquo; said McFarlane,
&ldquo;but things is changed now&mdash;I tell you you&rsquo;ve got
more&rsquo;n a fightin&rsquo; chance to win out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think this story of Mr. Garwood&rsquo;s irregularities&mdash;his
alleged irregularities,&rdquo; he corrected
himself with a lawyer&rsquo;s absurd habit of care in his
words, &ldquo;will seriously impair his prospects, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, sure, why wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; McFarlane urged.
&ldquo;We can make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, make it,&rdquo; observed Bromley. &ldquo;But how,
if you will oblige me? You must pardon my lack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>of knowledge of the&mdash;ah&mdash;technique of politics,
Mr. McFarlane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Judge,&rdquo; McFarlane hastened
to say, with a reassuring generosity of soul.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll we make it? Why, use it&mdash;that&rsquo;s how;
we&rsquo;ll make Jerry defend his record in the House.
We&rsquo;ll get the people to see it&mdash;that&rsquo;s how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But will the people believe it? They are slow,
you know, to believe these stories of boodling, as
I believe it is called. The newspapers have a good
deal to say of it from time to time, but I doubt if
the people take it much more seriously than the
rest of the current and conventional jokes of the
press. Do you think they&rsquo;ll believe it? That question
occurs to me as material at this point of
our&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe it! Do you think these farmers around
here&rsquo;d refuse to believe anything when you tell
&rsquo;em the corporations is behind it? Don&rsquo;t you think
they won&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no doubt, then, of its authenticity?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, course, I don&rsquo;t say as to that. Jerry&rsquo;s a
good fellow, all right enough. I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo;, between
ourselves, what he done at Springfield&mdash;it&rsquo;s
none o&rsquo; my business, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to know as much about it as me,
anyway, Judge. You&rsquo;re a corp&rsquo;ration lawyer&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
been to Springfield yourself, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer winced, and the natural ruddiness
of his healthy skin showed under his white beard
a deeper hue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have only been there to appear in the Supreme
or the Appellate Court, Mr. McFarlane; I
have no concern with any legislative lobbying my
clients may do, if they do any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure&mdash;&rsquo;scuse me, Judge&mdash;that&rsquo;s done by the
Chicago lawyers, of course; I didn&rsquo;t stop to think.&rdquo;
McFarlane had almost settled himself in his chair,
but at this <i>contretemps</i> he leaned forward again,
and then, wishing to give the action the effect of
interest rather than of embarrassment, he hastened
on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that ain&rsquo;t all, by a long shot. You know
Sprague&mdash;Con Sprague?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The present incumbent? Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, Jerry beat him for renomination,
or Jim Rankin did it fer &rsquo;im. Garwood had
promised Sprague to hold the Polk County delegation
fer &rsquo;im, he says, and, well, Rankin turned
a trick at the Clinton convention that euchred
Sprague out of the nomination. Course, Jim turned
round and tried to square it by throwin&rsquo; the legislative
nomination to Sprague&rsquo;s brother-in-law, Hank
Wilson; but still, Sprague&rsquo;s sore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet he is. He hasn&rsquo;t lifted a finger in the
whole campaign, an&rsquo; I heerd last night from Al
Granger, who&rsquo;s over from Sullivan, that his fellows
over there are openly knifing Garwood, and
that gives us a chance to carry Moultrie. Well,&rdquo;
McFarlane paused to swallow, &ldquo;we can carry DeWitt
here&mdash;it&rsquo;s your home county&mdash;and the majority
against us is less than a hundred; we have a good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>chance in Piatt, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re shaky about Logan,
particularly down in Millwood to&rsquo;nship. Garwood
had a meetin&rsquo; there the other day which was a frost&mdash;a
change of a hundred an&rsquo; fifty votes, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve
got &rsquo;em. Why, I tell you, man, it&rsquo;s the chance of
your life. You can win out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McFarlane spoke with the enthusiasm of that
confidence into which a politician can work himself
when he begins to juggle the handy figures
of old election returns, and some of his warmth
was communicated to the candidate, who felt his
blood tingle, and his heart rise in anticipation. He
had never allowed himself to think of the possibility
of his election, until that moment; but that
moment was the fatal one that comes to every candidate,
at a certain stage in his campaign, when
he begins to indulge in dreams of victory. And yet
Bromley was a wary man and he shrank again, in
his habit of judicial deliberation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak encouragingly, Mr. McFarlane,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but I do not quite share your confidence.
I am not the man to indulge in illusions. You
realize, of course, that I took the nomination at
some sacrifice, merely for the sake of the party. I
had no thought of being elected with the district
organized as it is under the present apportionment
act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, they carved the district out for
Sprague in their last gerrymander, an&rsquo; then
Sprague got thrown down fer the nomination&mdash;that&rsquo;s
why he&rsquo;s so sore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What plan do you propose?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said McFarlane, &ldquo;just what I told you.
We ought to poll every county in the district, make
a separate an&rsquo; distinct poll fer ourselves, independent
of the county committees, and then&mdash;get out
the vote. It&rsquo;ll take money, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Bromley was tapping his pencil lightly on
the desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I should make a personal canvass
of the district?&rdquo;</p>

<p>McFarlane hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that might be a good thing a
little later.&rdquo; He looked at the judge&rsquo;s clothes,
made by a Chicago tailor, as he supposed, though
they were made by a New York tailor, at his red
carnation, at his rimless <i>pince-nez</i>, and thought of
his campaigning in the rural districts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my idee fer the present &rsquo;uld be a still hunt.
We can work up to the brass band and the red
fire gradually, and wind up in a blaze o&rsquo; glory,
after we get &rsquo;em on the run. See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much will all this cost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, now, that&rsquo;s a question. Course, the
boys ain&rsquo;t in politics fer the&rsquo;r health, an&rsquo; the more
money we have the more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bromley, at this bald suggestion of a raid on
his pocket-book, flushed, this time angrily. He
dropped his pencil and tightened his fist, laying the
thick of it heavily on the edge of his desk. Then
he wheeled around, and said, his eyes contracting
behind his rimless aristocratic glasses:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, McFarlane, this must be a plain
business proposition. I have no barrel, as you call
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>it,&ldquo;&mdash;though McFarlane had said nothing about a
barrel&mdash;&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve already given all I can afford
to the campaign. I would be willing, perhaps,
as a further sacrifice to the party and my principles,
to increase my contribution, but I&rsquo;d want
to know just what was done with it; I&rsquo;d want every
bill audited by a responsible committee; I&rsquo;d want
it all used properly and effectively; in other words,
I&rsquo;d expect results&mdash;do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, course, Judge, just as you say. It&rsquo;s your
campaign, you know. I&rsquo;m only showin&rsquo; you where
you can win out, that&rsquo;s all. If you don&rsquo;t care
nothin&rsquo; about goin&rsquo; to Congress&mdash;why, all right. It
needn&rsquo;t cost much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <i>how</i> much, that&rsquo;s the question?&rdquo; demanded
Bromley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, three or four thousand, perhaps;
maybe five. Hell! I can&rsquo;t tell exactly. It&rsquo;s no
cinch, the amount ain&rsquo;t. A couple o&rsquo; thousand
&rsquo;uld do fer a starter, till we could tell how she developed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bromley received McFarlane&rsquo;s estimate in silence,
and looked somewhere out of his window
for support. McFarlane sat and eyed him keenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Garwood any means?&rdquo; the lawyer asked
presently, and then immediately answered his own
question by observing: &ldquo;I suppose not, though;
his practice, as I suppose he calls it, is confined to
the personal injury business.&rdquo; The judge said this
with a corporation lawyer&rsquo;s contempt for one who
has no money and whose practice is confined to
the speculative side of personal injury cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jerry&rsquo;s poor,&rdquo; said McFarlane. &ldquo;But I hear
it rumored that old Ethan Harkness&rsquo;s puttin&rsquo; up
some fer &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ethan Harkness? The banker over at Grand
Prairie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should he provide means for Garwood&rsquo;s
campaign?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t ask me&mdash;that&rsquo;s what the boys says.
Seems to me, though, I heerd somethin&rsquo; about
Jerry&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to marry his daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-m-m-m!&rdquo; the judge said, and then he was
silent for a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody would have to put up fer &rsquo;im,&rdquo; McFarlane
continued. &ldquo;I hear he hain&rsquo;t paid none o&rsquo;
his campaign assessments yet, an&rsquo; that hain&rsquo;t
helpin&rsquo; him none. That&rsquo;ll be another thing in your
favor, too, Judge&mdash;unless old Harkness does hear
an&rsquo; heed the Mac&rsquo;donian cry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly can imagine Ethan Harkness giving
away money for any purpose, much less a purpose
of that sort,&rdquo; said the judge, with the first twinkle
in his eye that had sparkled behind his lenses since
McFarlane had mentioned money. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t
place much credence in that story about Garwood&rsquo;s
wedding Miss Harkness. The Harknesses are
really a very good family, as I remember to have
heard Mrs. Bromley say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McFarlane did not care to venture on the unsafe
ground of society, and so was silent. The
judge, too, was silent. He was pondering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. McFarlane,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>consider your suggestion carefully, and you may
call to-morrow morning, if you will be so good,
when I shall have a conclusion ready for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge looked at McFarlane with the glance
that terminates the interviews of a busy man, especially
a man busy in corporation interests, where
the personal equation may be largely ignored, and
waited for McFarlane to leave.</p>

<p>McFarlane went down the stairs, chuckling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He took the bit all right,&rdquo; he said to the man
who was waiting for him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go have a nice
little drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>THAN HARKNESS was sitting in his
library, as the architect who had remodeled
his old house had named the pleasant apartment
that opened off the living-room. Here, out of
deference to the idea, Emily had her books, as well
as the few her father read, disposed upon low
shelves; and here the old man passed his hours at
home, because, as he loved to say, in his whimsical
pretense that he was in the way, he would bother
no one. His habit was to sit here every evening
and smoke his cigar over his newspaper. Perhaps
he would read some book Emily had urged upon
him, though he never liked the books she recommended.
Once in every year he read Scott&rsquo;s novels
through, at least he was one of those persons of
whom that highly colored tale is told. Emily, in
her new appreciation of the realistic, had joined in
the cultured revolt against the romantic school, and
would not own to the least respect for Scott. Once
in a while, when her father, in his devices to induce
her to read the Wizard, would complain of his
eyes hurting him, and ask her to read Rob Roy
to him, she would do so until he nodded, and then
when he had gone to bed, would take the book to
her room and read until the house was still and
cold with the silence and chill of midnight, so that
she was afraid to move. But such occasions she
declared to be literary debauches, and would tell
her father at breakfast that she was ashamed of
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>He was sitting thus one evening, under the lamp,
its soft mellow light falling on his silver hair;
his glasses far down upon his high-bridged nose,
his book held up before them. He breathed heavily
as he read, and Emily, pausing an instant in
the doorway, gazed upon him, thinking, with a love
that to her had a touch of pathos, of all his kindly
ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All alone, as usual?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The old man took off his glasses slowly, closed
his book upon them to mark his place, and then
looked gravely up, waiting for her to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tone was one to alarm the old man, and he
sighed. He had reached the time of life when he
dreaded change, and her tone had the note of
change in it.</p>

<p>She sat down in a little rocking-chair before him,
knitting her fingers together, her white hands
lying in her lap. Her eyes were fixed upon a ring
that sparkled on her finger&mdash;a ring that Garwood
had bought, on credit, at Maxwell the jeweler&rsquo;s,
that morning. Harkness waited for her to speak
with the same gravity with which he had waited
for Garwood to speak an evening long ago, when
the voting man had ventured in upon him, trying to
assume a dignity the beating of his heart threatened,
just as the beating of the old man&rsquo;s heart
now threatened the gravity he had assumed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>Though there was a difference; the old man was
aware that it was not well for him that his heart
should beat as it was beating in that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; the girl said, twirling the ring on her
finger, the light from the lamp flashing a dozen
spectra from the facets of the diamond, &ldquo;Jerome
and I are going to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; she added, thinking he had not caught
the full significance of her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; he said, in hollow repetition. But he
did not turn his head or move.</p>

<p>He had expected it some day, he had even
wished it, for in his old-fashioned conservatism he
did not like to think of Emily as an old maid, but
he had hoped that it would be a day long in coming.</p>

<p>Emily raised her eyes and looked at him. His
hair seemed whiter, his face suddenly older, he appeared
so lonely. As she looked a tear oozed
from his eye and slid down his cheek and beard.
And then she leaned forward, folded her arms on
his knees, pillowed her head upon them, and wept.</p>

<p>The old man placed his hand upon her coils of
hair, patting them softly. But he was silent. The
mood passed, the old man possessed himself, laid
his book on the table, and sighed with relief,
as if at the end of some painful scene. He grew
restless, but the girl held him; drew closer, embraced
him passionately at the last, and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t leave you, father, I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I won&rsquo;t!
It&rsquo;ll be just the same for us&mdash;tell me it will!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>The old man smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that part of it&rsquo;ll be all right.
But tell me&mdash;what&rsquo;s the rush?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, father, there isn&rsquo;t any rush&mdash;only, don&rsquo;t
you know how every one&rsquo;s against him just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not if the reports of his
meetings is correct, they hain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know; but they tell such stories about
him, and this horrible roorback&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that what
they call it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depends on who you mean by they,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; she said, in the assumption
that avoided explanations, &ldquo;I want to show them
that I believe in him, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like you, Em,&rdquo; he said, smiling at her.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like your mother, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was touched by this. He seldom spoke of
her mother. And she drew nearer to him, and
ran her fingers fondly through his white hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been thinking of her?&rdquo; she asked,
with a tender reverence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some&mdash;to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She stuck up for
me once.&rdquo; And then he was silent again.</p>

<p>The girl, with the impatience of youth, tried to
coax him away from his sad humor, and assumed
a happy tone, though she blinked to keep back her
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t be for a long time, really, father&mdash;not
till fall, not till after election, anyway. And it
shan&rsquo;t make any difference, shall it? No, we&rsquo;ll all
be so happy together. You and Jerome can play
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>cards in the evening&mdash;and it&rsquo;ll be ever so much
livelier in this big, empty old house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man conceived the picture she imagined
for him, but one of his grotesque humors came
upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think Mother Garwood&rsquo;ll like the board?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Emily protested, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d joke at a
funeral!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="XIII">XIII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE seven members of the congressional committee,
assembled in Judge Bromley&rsquo;s office,
sat in a circle around the wall, beneath the
pictures of Chief-justice Marshall, of Daniel Webster,
and of Blackstone, reflecting in their faces,
with a studied effort that pained them, the seriousness
of those jurists. They sat in silence, looking
now and then one at another, or most of all at McFarlane,
the chairman, who by virtue of his office
sat nearest the roll-top desk of the judge, and, out
of a disposition to show the ease of his footing with
the candidate, carelessly swung back and forth the
revolving bookcase, which creaked under its load
of the Illinois Reports and Kinney&rsquo;s Digest.</p>

<p>The members of the committee were smoking
cigars from a box the judge had provided, a box of
five-cent domestic cigars, which fouled the atmosphere
of the private office with their thick
white smoke. The smoke from the Havana cigar
the judge himself was smoking, wriggled upward
in a blue wraith from the white hand that held it,
and the judge only raised the cigar to his lips often
enough to keep it alight, and as if to aid his mental
processes. These processes were doubtless profound,
for he bent his head, and wrinkled his brow,
and looked intently at the silver-mounted furnishings
of his desk. He had already sat there what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>seemed to the waiting politicians a long time, and
had not moved. But at last he dropped the eraser
with which he had been playing while he thought,
and, lightly touching the revolving bookcase, for
its swing and creak made him nervous, he gave a
judicial cough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have asked you to meet here, gentlemen,&rdquo; he
began, half turning in his swivel chair, &ldquo;to discuss
some features of my campaign. You, all of you,
no doubt, were apprised, at the convention of our
party, of the reluctance I felt in accepting the
nomination; you, all of you, are aware, at what
personal sacrifice I consented to allow my name
to be used, so that it is unnecessary for me to discuss
this feature of the case at this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge said this impressively, with his brows
lowered, as if he were charging a jury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to this time, it has not seemed to me advisable
to make an active personal canvass, and as you
know, I have not done so, preferring to leave to
you the execution of such plans as might suggest
themselves to the consideration of your&mdash;ah&mdash;excellent
committee. But recently, events have developed
that induce me to alter any resolutions I
may have formed to continue in such a course.
You, all of you, are acquainted with these events,
much better acquainted, I may say, than I, so that
I need not touch upon them in detail. Within the
last two or three weeks, I have noticed that a
strong undercurrent of public opinion has set in
toward our ticket.&rdquo; The judge illustrated the undercurrent
by moving his hand gracefully along at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>a horizontal plane above the floor. &ldquo;If I understand
the temper of our people, and the prevailing
signs of the times, they are ready for a change in
the guidance of their affairs&mdash;to be brief, I think
that we have an excellent chance to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet we have, Judge,&rdquo; broke in Hadley,
from Tazewell.</p>

<p>The judge raised his head and looked his surprise
at Hadley, as if to resent the interruption,
and the members of the committee turned and
looked at Hadley severely. Murch, who sat next
Hadley, drove an elbow into the man&rsquo;s ribs, and
Hadley&rsquo;s bronzed face became a deeper shade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I observed,&rdquo; said Bromley, anxious that his
observation be not lost, &ldquo;I think we have an excellent
chance of winning, better than we have had in
any congressional campaign within my memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge paused here to let the conviction that
his own personality had produced this unusual
political condition sink into the minds of his auditors.
And then he resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have followed me thus far, gentlemen,
you will be prepared for the announcement I am
about to make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused again impressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have determined, gentlemen, to enter upon
the prosecution of a vigorous personal campaign.
In short, I shall take the stump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped, and looked around him. The committee-men,
not expecting him to leave off in his
address so soon, were not prepared for its end,
and so had to bestir themselves and simulate a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>proper appreciation of the effect of his announcement.
McFarlane murmured some sort of approval,
and his words were repeated around the
circle. Judge Bromley leaned back in his chair,
with his elbow on his desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall take the stump,&rdquo; he repeated, showing
his love for the phrase, which he had been accustomed
to see in newspapers all his days when the
doings of eminent politicians were chronicled,
&ldquo;and have determined to open my campaign in Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Garwood&rsquo;s
own county, in his own town,
Grand Prairie. I believe you are the committee-man
for Polk County, Mr. Funk, are you not?&rdquo; He
turned to a lank man leaning his long body forward,
his sharp elbows on his knees, who now
looked up languidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? I reckon I am,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the judge continued, &ldquo;can we arrange
for a meeting in your county?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reckon we can,&rdquo; replied Funk, &ldquo;if we can raise
the price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge scowled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall, of course, provide for that,&rdquo; he said.
At the words Funk straightened up, and a revival
of interest was apparent in the other members of
the group.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you suggest&mdash;an open-air meeting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know as I would,&rdquo; said Funk. &ldquo;Open-air
meetin&rsquo;s is dangerous&mdash;mightn&rsquo;t be enough turn
out to fill all outdoors. Course, we might have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>a torch-light percession, to draw a crowd&mdash;if we
had the torches and a band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That can be arranged,&rdquo; said the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might have the meetin&rsquo; in the op&rsquo;ra house,&rdquo;
Funk went on. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think, Neal?&rdquo; He deferred
to McFarlane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me the op&rsquo;ra house would be safer,&rdquo;
said McFarlane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, of course, is a matter to be considered,&rdquo;
said Bromley. &ldquo;But at any rate, I wish to have
meetings announced in all the counties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The silence which had oppressed the members of
the committee having been broken by the words
of Funk and McFarlane, the conversation became
general, and grew in interest until McFarlane
voiced the burden that lay at the bottom of all
their hearts by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judge, how &rsquo;bout the funds? You know what
we was sayin&rsquo; the other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bromley, &ldquo;I recall our conversation.
I shall meet all legitimate expenses&mdash;ah&mdash;as they
arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an instant depreciation of interest,
and when the men filed down the stairs half an
hour later, McFarlane again voiced the burden
of their hearts by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to hold onto his pile, boys. All bills
to be paid on vouchers signed by the auditor and
presented to the treasurer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McFarlane liked to recall to his friends his six
months in the State House, and spoke at times
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>in the language of the bills he had enrolled and
engrossed so often during that experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, a lawyer that tries his own case has a
fool for a client,&rdquo; said Mason, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s that-away
&rsquo;ith a candidate that manages his own campaign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bromley had been led to his resolution to take
the stump by two incidents. One, the first, occurred
at Chicago. He had gone there to attend
a banquet of the State Bar Association, and
had made a speech. Though he had been accustomed
to the court room all his life, and had
spoken much to juries, and oftener to courts, he
was deliberative and judicial, rather than epideictic,
and had acquired the dry, sophistical manner
of speaking which comes to those happy and distinguished
lawyers whose causes are heard with
more sympathy by the solemn judges of the courts
of appeal, than by the juries in the <i>nisi prius</i> courts,
and he had shrunk from popular oratory.</p>

<p>But at the bar banquet, having drunk wine, he
spoke at length, and as he progressed so loved the
sound of his own voice, that when he sat down he
found himself for the first time in his life in an
oratorical perspiration. And then, before the flush
of his intellectual activity had left him, ideas more
brilliant than those he had had while on his feet
came to him in such profusion that he had longed
to repeat his effort. He felt that he could do so
much better, though he felt that he had done well,
for the long board, sweeping away with its glistening
glass, and surrounded by so many ruddy men
in brave shirt-fronts, had run round with applause.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>To crown his triumph the man next to him had
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judge, why don&rsquo;t you take the stump?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words had coursed gladly through his veins
like the wine he had drunk. He felt that he had
found himself at last.</p>

<p>The sense of triumph had not altogether left him
by the next morning, and as he sat at his late
breakfast at his hotel, seeking an account of the
banquet in the <i>Courier</i>, his name had suddenly
leaped to his eyes out of all the thousands of words
packed on the page, and he read with a gasp a
despatch from Springfield, which reviewed political
conditions in the state.</p>

<p>The paragraph devoted to the Thirteenth Congressional
District said, among other things:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judge Bromley thus far has not taken the
stump, and the impression is general that he is
conscious of his own limitations as an orator. In
the Supreme Court, arguing a case for some of
his wealthy clients, he is perfectly at home, but he
is not the kind of man that takes on the stump
before a promiscuous crowd. Realizing this, the
astute managers of his campaign have kept the
judge at home and are making a still hunt. Meanwhile,
young Jerry Garwood, who has oratorical
powers of a high order, and who has unsuccessfully
tried to draw Bromley into a joint debate,
is speaking nightly to big audiences all over the
District.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge grew angry as he read this, and he
made his resolve in that hour. A few days later,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>when the excitement of his success at the bar banquet
had left him, and he imagined himself speaking
to jostling thousands before him, under the
flare and swirl of torches&rsquo; yellow flames, he would
turn cold with fear. But he was a determined man,
and he could not resist the pleasing sound of the
words that announced his intention to take the
stump. Proclamation was duly made, after what
he politely called his conference with the committee,
that he would open his speaking tour in Grand
Prairie, with some more phrases, equally pleasing
to him, about &ldquo;throwing down the gauntlet,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;carrying the war into the enemy&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over in Grand Prairie, Jim Rankin read the announcement
with glee; out on Sangamon Avenue,
Emily Harkness read it, and clenched her little fists,
saying to herself that it was an impertinence in
Bromley to come into Jerome&rsquo;s own town; in a
little hotel over in Monticello, Garwood read it
with concern, wondering what it could mean, while
away over in the Galesburg District, on a train
that was rolling out of Monmouth, Charley Cowley,
the <i>Courier&rsquo;s</i> political correspondent, who had
written the paragraph in his Springfield despatch
at Rankin&rsquo;s request, showed his teeth in that odd
smile of his. And up in Chicago, in the breakfast
room of the Grand Hotel, the chairman of the state
committee of the party Judge Bromley represented,
read it and swore to himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The damn fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the calm October days that followed, mysterious
and subtle forces were at work all over
the Thirteenth District. The green trees of the
windbreaks changed to red and gold, the brown
fields were tented with tepees of yellow corn; in and
out among the stubble, and along the sides of the
black roads, still dry and velvety from the summer&rsquo;s
warmth, brown prairie-chickens rustled covertly,
and over all, over the fields, the woods, the
roads and the scattered towns, the blue sky bent
with a haze that had melancholy reminiscences of
the lost spring, and the benediction of peaceful
autumn.</p>

<p>Emily, sitting in the sunlight that streamed
through the tall bay windows of her room, stitched
away on her white wedding garments, dreaming
in her smiles of the new life that was just opening
to her, picturing Garwood, a great, strong man,
fighting the battles of his country, just as his old
mother, sitting with her knitting by her low window,
wrinkling her brow as she lifted her eyes
now and then over her spectacles to gaze on her
withering flower-beds in the little yard, pictured
him as a little boy, playing on the floor, charming
her with his precocious speeches.</p>

<p>Amid all this beauty and mystery, men were
fighting one another, bribing, deceiving and coercing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>one another, in order that the offices of the
republic might be taken from one set of men and
turned over to another set of men. This condition
prevailed over all the land. Everywhere men left
work to talk and shout of this great battle, all
of them pretending, of course, that they did this
for the good of those whom they were vilifying
and hating and accusing; claiming that the country
would be lost unless their own side won. For
instance, Judge Bromley had laid aside his dignity
and was traveling all over the counties that made
up the Thirteenth Congressional District of Illinois,
urging people to vote for him because Garwood,
as he charged, while a member of the Legislature,
had accepted a bribe. The judge did not know
whether this was true or not, but he used all the
powers he had cultivated in his four years in college,
his three years in the law school, his lifetime
at the bar and on the bench, to make people believe
it was so; and he gave, though not so freely, of
the money he had made by these same talents of
persuasion and dissimulation, to organize clubs
that would bind men to believe it.</p>

<p>At the same time Garwood was going up and
down, urging people to vote for him because his
opponent was the paid attorney of the same corporation
which Bromley said had given the bribe;
and using all his talents to make people believe
him instead of Bromley. Much of this was said
under the guise of discussing the tariff question; as
to whether the people could be made the happier by
taxing one another much or little; though neither
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>side could have had the happiness of the people at
heart, for, in all the national turmoil, both sides
were doing all they could to defeat and humiliate
those who differed from them in opinion on little
details of government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a change as subtle and as mysterious
as that of autumn was going on in the feelings of
men over the outcome of this great conflict. In
the Thirteenth District, from believing that Garwood
would be elected, they began to believe that
he would be defeated. No one could explain or
analyze this change of sentiment, but his opponents
were gladdened by it, and his adherents saddened
by it; many of them wavered in their belief in
him and in their adherence to him, being drawn by
a desire to be on the winning side.</p>

<p>Rankin was one of the first to perceive this
change. His political sensibilities were acute from
long training, he could estimate public sentiment
accurately, and early in the campaign he had
warned Garwood that before election the day
would come when they would feel that they were
losing ground; he had hoped that it would come
early in the campaign, but now that it had come,
with but three weeks in which to overcome its
effects, Rankin carefully kept the fact from Garwood.
The letters that he wrote him, the telegrams
he sent him, the advice he gave when Garwood
came home for Sunday, tired and worn from
his nerve-exhausting labors, were all to give him
better heart to continue the struggle. Garwood
himself, speaking nightly to crowds that cheered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>him, living and moving in an atmosphere of constant
adulation and applause, fortunately could not
recognize the condition that alarmed Rankin. It
seemed to him, just as it seems to every candidate,
that all the people were for him, because he never
met any who were against him.</p>

<p>Bromley had opened his campaign in Grand Prairie
with a meeting which, by its size, alarmed Rankin
more than he would admit. He had his fun out
of it, of course, saying that Bromley, like all the
rich, would do better to let his money talk for
him, and assuring Bromley&rsquo;s party workers that
the opening of his fountains of eloquence meant
the closing of his barrel. He made the discovery,
too, that the judge, while on his campaign tour,
slept in silken pajamas, and he made much of this
in appeals to the prejudices of the farmers, knowing
how this symbol of the luxury of Bromley&rsquo;s
life would affect them. Rankin dubbed him
&ldquo;Pajamas&rdquo; Bromley, and the stigma stuck, and
yet he was too wise to believe that he could overcome
the effect of Bromley&rsquo;s money by mere words
and names. This was why he made the trip over
to Sullivan to see Sprague.</p>

<p>He found Sprague sitting in his law office, reading
a newspaper in the idleness of a country lawyer,
a cuspidor placed conveniently near. Sprague was
a large man, with a tousled mass of gray hair, and
a short, shaggy beard burnished by the red of its
youth, though it was now lightened by gray. He
wore, after the older professional ideal, a long,
black frock coat, though that he did not go thoroughly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>into the details of sartorial effects was
shown by the muddy tan shoes that cocked their
worn heels on the edge of his desk.</p>

<p>Conrad Sprague had once been considered a
clever man; when admitted to the bar he was one
of those youths of whom it is said, &ldquo;He has a
bright future&rdquo;; and, like many such, Sprague had
mistaken the promise for the fulfilment, and had
been content to use the superficial acquirements
which had given him a place in the debating society
of the Ohio college he had attended, before
going out to Illinois to &ldquo;locate,&rdquo; as the phrase was,
without strengthening them by newer studies.
While waiting for a law practice, he had gone into
politics, originally for the purpose of securing an
acquaintance that would help him in his profession,
and ultimately, when his political duties interfered
so constantly with his legal duties that he
could not attend to such practice as came to him,
as a means of livelihood in itself. Thus his law
office became in time but a background for his
career in politics. He had been successful at first;
he had gone to the Legislature and once to Congress.
Now, in his defeat, with only the remnant
of his loosely organized following left to him, he
was undergoing the spiritual fermentation which
disappointment works in weak natures, and gave
promise of souring altogether.</p>

<p>Sprague did not rise when Rankin entered, nor
even remove his feet from his desk. But he did
lay his paper in his long lap, then slowly taking the
black-rimmed eye-glasses from his nose, and dangling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>them at the end of their tangled and knotted
cord, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Jim; where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just landed in,&rdquo; replied Rankin, pulling up a
cane-seated chair and dropping his heavy body
into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said Rankin, rocking back and
forth, &ldquo;damned important business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sprague, moved by the snapping tone, twisted
his body and looked squarely at Rankin. He made
a movement of his legs as if he would take his feet
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Rankin went on, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re
the man I come to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sprague dropped his feet to the floor, swung his
chair half around on one of its legs, and as it came
down he brought it into a position directly facing
Rankin. He looked at his caller almost angrily
for an instant, but adopting the more peaceful tone
in which he would have addressed a new client, he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Rankin, &ldquo;since that&rsquo;s what I
come fer. You can get out and do something to
help land Garwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sprague puckered his lips, turned his head away
and whistled reflectively. The whistle was a series
of low, tuneless notes, and was irritating to Rankin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>who, though a fat man, developed nerves at
times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim,&rdquo; said Sprague at last, &ldquo;you know
that I haven&rsquo;t been taking any active interest in
this campaign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s just the trouble,&rdquo; said Rankin, &ldquo;you
haven&rsquo;t. But some o&rsquo; your fellers has, an&rsquo; I want
you to call &rsquo;em off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sprague stopped whistling and looked at Rankin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Jim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what some of my
friends may be doing I don&rsquo;t know. They seem to
think, some of them, that they have cause for dissatisfaction
in the way I was treated at the Clinton
convention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come off, now,&rdquo; said Rankin. &ldquo;You know
that won&rsquo;t go &rsquo;ith me, Con. You know how much
chance you ever had at the Clinton convention,
and you know jus&rsquo; what I told you there in the
Gleason House that night before we met. So
don&rsquo;t try to come any o&rsquo; that old gag on me, &rsquo;cause
I won&rsquo;t stand fer it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Sprague began, in a voice that indicated
a want of conviction on his part, lifting his brows to
add to the effect of the tone. He ended by spitting
at his convenient cuspidor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care &rsquo;bout me,&rdquo; said Rankin; &ldquo;go
in an&rsquo; abuse me all you want. Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t nobody&rsquo;ll
believe you, anyhow. Everybody knows&rsquo;t I
never broke a promise in my life, an&rsquo; that I al&rsquo;ays
stood pat fer my friends&mdash;which you wasn&rsquo;t one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>o&rsquo; them, so long&rsquo;s I can remember&mdash;but that don&rsquo;t
cut any figur&rsquo; here ner there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always supposed we were friends, Jim,&rdquo;
Sprague complained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right&mdash;in politics, I mean. I
hain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in you pers&rsquo;nally, course, but in
politics we&rsquo;ve al&rsquo;ays been ag&rsquo;in each other, an&rsquo; ther&rsquo;
ain&rsquo;t no use tryin&rsquo; to ignore that now. You&rsquo;ve
been sore ever since the convention, of course, an&rsquo;
I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I blame you fer it, but we beat you
fair an&rsquo; square, an&rsquo; I come over here to tell you
that we expect you to get out an&rsquo; support the
ticket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did, did you?&rdquo; said Sprague, with half
a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said Rankin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sprague, deliberately stopping to
spit again, &ldquo;I supposed that after the Clinton convention
I might consider myself out of politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you <i>might</i>,&rdquo; Rankin rejoined, &ldquo;but the
trouble is, you <i>don&rsquo;t</i>, an&rsquo; your fellers right here
in Moultrie County is out with the&rsquo;r knives fer
Jerry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if they are,&rdquo; said Sprague, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I
didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell, now, Con,&rdquo; expostulated Rankin, disgustedly,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t fer God&rsquo;s sake use that &rsquo;ith me.
Maybe it goes down to Washin&rsquo;ton, I don&rsquo; know,
but it don&rsquo;t go here, not &rsquo;ith me, &rsquo;t any rate. You
know what they&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; so do I. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
just tell you this,&rdquo; Rankin leaned over and laid his
hand on the edge of Sprague&rsquo;s desk, while Sprague
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>eyed him with disfavour, &ldquo;that if you expect to be
in politics any more they&rsquo;ve got to stop it, an&rsquo; stop
it now, an&rsquo; if they don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if they don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Sprague interrupted in an
ugly, defiant note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t, why, don&rsquo;t ever dare stick your
head up out o&rsquo; your crab-hole ag&rsquo;in; an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s
more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more?&rdquo; repeated Sprague, nodding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a game two can play at. We&rsquo;ve got a
few knives over in Polk County, and, while they&rsquo;re
a little rusty an&rsquo; out o&rsquo; use, they&rsquo;re long, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re
deadly, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em out at once an&rsquo; run &rsquo;em
into that brother-&rsquo;n-law o&rsquo; yourn about that
fur&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin measured off the sickening distance on
his left arm, with his right hand at the elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; turn &rsquo;em round,&rdquo; and Rankin twisted his
fist savagely. In illustrating the vengeful deed he
had allowed some of his excitement to master
him, and he rose now and stood hanging over
Sprague with a menace in the droop of his shoulders
and the stretch of his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you know the business that brought me
here, Con Sprague,&rdquo; Rankin went on. &ldquo;I come
over to tell this to Wilson, but I thought it &rsquo;uld be
fair to tell you first. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; over to tell him, an&rsquo;
then I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; back home. Now, if your brother-&rsquo;n-law
wants to go to the Legislature, just you get
out an&rsquo; make a few speeches fer Garwood, an&rsquo; declare
y&rsquo;urself, an&rsquo; you an&rsquo; him put y&rsquo;ur fellers over
here to work, an&rsquo; you do it in two days. I&rsquo;ll watch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>you an&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t do it, I&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;plunk,&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Rankin
used the word which the Illinois politicians,
doubtless in their distrust of anything British, have
substituted for the Englishman&rsquo;s &ldquo;plump&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo;
the boys&rsquo;ll plunk&mdash;an&rsquo; fer the first time in our history
we&rsquo;ll send a minority representative to Springfield,
an&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t be your brother-&rsquo;n-law, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sprague&rsquo;s face blackened. He knew that dangerous
possibility in cumulative voting, but he
said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you fer any answer,&rdquo; said Rankin.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve served notice on you. You can do just
as you damn please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then Rankin went away. He made his call
on Wilson, By night he was back in Grand Prairie.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="XV">XV</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the early twilight of a Saturday afternoon late
in October Garwood walked up Kaskaskia
Street from the station in a cold, sullen rain,
conscious of but one sensation&mdash;he was glad that
only one more week of the campaign remained.
He walked with long, deliberate strides, indifferent
to the rain, which had beaten down his wide hat
brim and trickled off it, before and behind, in little
streams. His face, under those drooping eaves,
was long and serious; it brightened, automatically,
only when he met some pedestrian to whom in his
capacity as a candidate, he involuntarily spoke a
greeting.</p>

<p>Garwood had come home in response to a telegram
from Rankin, a telegram which had concentrated
such an urgency into its economically chosen
ten words that he had traveled many miles since
daylight over country roads and by rail to reach
Grand Prairie at night. Now, just as the twilight
was darkening and the lights were beginning to
show in the stores along Main Street, he turned
into the Lawrence Block and climbed to his office.
The office was dark; young Enright, who was reading
law under him, had gone into the country
to make one of the political speeches he was proud
of having been asked to deliver that fall; the typewriter
had closed her desk and gone, and her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>little clock was ticking lonesomely beside her
little vase of flowers. But in his private room,
Garwood found Rankin sitting with his feet on the
window-sill looking abstractedly down into the
street where the lights from the store-windows
wriggled in many lines across the canal of mud.</p>

<p>Garwood took off his hat, lashed it back and
forth to get the water off, and slapped it down
on the top of his desk. And then he said, in a voice
that was rough and hoarse:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter? Everything&rsquo;s gone
to hell, I suppose&mdash;heh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s all right. I just want a talk with you,&rdquo;
said Rankin. &ldquo;Have a good meetin&rsquo; last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, first-rate; made a poor speech, though.
Truth is, I&rsquo;m about done up. Thank God it&rsquo;ll be
over in another week, whichever way it goes. Don&rsquo;t
know that I care&rdquo;&mdash;his sentence was broken by a
cough that shook him.</p>

<p>Rankin turned and tried to distinguish his features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look&rsquo;e here, Jerry,&rdquo; said the big fellow, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
got a cold&mdash;you&rsquo;ll best go down and have Chris mix
you a hot tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Garwood, scraping his
throat. &ldquo;Go on with your tale of woe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Rankin with evident reluctance,
&ldquo;I hate to tell you, but the truth is, we&rsquo;ve got to
have some money, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;
from. I&rsquo;ve spent all we had, an&rsquo; more, too, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ve held up everybody here in town till I&rsquo;ve
squeezed &rsquo;em dry. They don&rsquo;t like to give to us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>anyway; most of &rsquo;em has already contributed to the
county fund, an&rsquo; they think that&rsquo;s enough. I can&rsquo;t
use all the county funds fer you; the candidates is
kickin&rsquo; already; they say I&rsquo;ve been neglectin&rsquo; &rsquo;em
fer you, an&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t do to git &rsquo;em sore on us&mdash;&rsquo;taint
hardly square nohow. Damned if I like it.
We&rsquo;ve got along so fur, but now we&rsquo;re up to the
limit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t the Hutchinsons give?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they put all theirn in the county fund, so&rsquo;s
to elect Sanford; they say anyhow a congressman
can&rsquo;t help &rsquo;em; they&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; fer the treas&rsquo;rer only&mdash;all
they care fer is the bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with those bankers,&rdquo; said Garwood.
&ldquo;Hogs, all of them. That&rsquo;s what we get
for giving them Sanford. If we&rsquo;d nominated a
fellow of our own for treasurer we might have
forced him to lay down on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right, but that time&rsquo;s gone by now,
no use cryin&rsquo; over spilt milk. We&rsquo;ve got to face
the present. We owe a good many bills, some fer
printin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they wait till after election?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe they might, but I hate to ask &rsquo;em; it
wouldn&rsquo;t help us any. The postage&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve
paid all that out o&rsquo; my own pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how I appreciate that, Jim, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Rankin, waving his
gratitude aside. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the <i>Citizen</i> an&rsquo; some
other papers over the district, they&rsquo;re beginning to
clamor fer the&rsquo;r money.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular hold-up, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to expect in politics,&rdquo;
said Rankin. &ldquo;But if that &rsquo;as all we might take
care of it. The situation has taken a curious turn
this last week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Garwood, who had suffered
from a candidate&rsquo;s myopia, and could not note the
numerous turns a situation takes during a campaign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way. The committees is all kickin&rsquo;
because your assessments hasn&rsquo;t been paid. I&rsquo;ve
been tryin&rsquo; to make a poor man&rsquo;s campaign fer you,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve succeeded pretty well so fur, if I do say it
myself. But the boys needs money everywhere;
they want to finish up the&rsquo;r poll, and over in Moultrie,
where we had to deal with the Sprague kickers,
a little money has just <i>got</i> to be used, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d fixed Sprague?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I made him come down, o&rsquo; course, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t trust the dirty whelp out o&rsquo; my sight on&rsquo;y
when I could see him, as the old widow woman
said of her grandson, an&rsquo; I think we ought to pay
the assessment over there anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo; asked Garwood, with the pain
an unrendered bill can give one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two hundred,&rdquo; said Rankin. &ldquo;The boys over
there say&mdash;shall I tell you what they say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; go on, I can stand anything nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they say that now you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to marry
ol&rsquo; man Harkness&rsquo;s daughter, you&rsquo;d ought to get
him to put up fer you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Garwood, in his hoarse voice, swore an oath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m just tellin&rsquo; you what they say. They&rsquo;re
sayin&rsquo; that right here to home, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo; it
pretty much all over the district. They think Harkness
is made o&rsquo; money, an&rsquo; that it &rsquo;uld be easy fer
him to put up some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they ever known him to put up any for
a campaign?&rdquo; asked Garwood with a sardonic smile
that Rankin could not see in the gloom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, reckon not; but they look to you to loosen
him up. But let me tell you,&rdquo; Rankin hastened on,
as if he had pleasanter information, &ldquo;you know
Bromley, when he got good an&rsquo; goin&rsquo;, let loose a
lot of his money&mdash;just sowed it &rsquo;round freely fer
two or three weeks, an&rsquo; it kind o&rsquo; made up fer the
mistakes he was makin&rsquo; on the stump. But
now he&rsquo;s done just what I knowed he&rsquo;d do&mdash;here
with election a week off, he&rsquo;s got skeered an&rsquo; froze
up stiff an&rsquo; cold, tighter&rsquo;n a mill race in January&mdash;not
a red cent &rsquo;ill he bleed now, an&rsquo; the whole push
is sore on &rsquo;im. But I knowed he&rsquo;d do it, I knowed
it, from the very first.&rdquo; Rankin chuckled at his
own prophetic instinct. &ldquo;So you see, we&rsquo;d ought
to take advantage of the situation. If I had a little
money to use judiciously, I&rsquo;d have &rsquo;em licked to a
stand-still a week from to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin rubbed his palms in the enthusiasm he
would have felt in such a triumphant finish to his
campaign, while Garwood&rsquo;s heart beat a little higher
as he thought of the security he would feel in
the possession of a campaign fund. The little wave
of excitement brought on a return of his cough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; now, Jerry,&rdquo; Rankin resumed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
why I sent fer you.&rdquo; He drew his chair closer to
Garwood, and laid his hand on Garwood&rsquo;s knee.
&ldquo;My God, man!&rdquo; he exclaimed, suddenly. &ldquo;You
been sittin&rsquo; here in clothes as wet as that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on,&rdquo; said Garwood. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear what
you have to say. Don&rsquo;t mind me, I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll make it short,&rdquo; said Rankin. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
then we&rsquo;ll go down to Chris&rsquo;s. What I want to
suggest is this&mdash;I hate to do it, but it&rsquo;s a groun&rsquo;hog
case, an&rsquo; you an&rsquo; me&rsquo;s ol&rsquo; friends&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; urged Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Rankin continued, with a reluctance, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like to&mdash;but here goes. We&rsquo;ve got to have
money&mdash;an&rsquo; I thought&mdash;well, that you might jus&rsquo;
go to old man Harkness an&rsquo; make a little touch&mdash;fer
a thousand, say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood had already begun shaking his head
vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jim, no,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;not for all the world.
It&rsquo;s impossible; I can&rsquo;t think of it. You can understand
my position&mdash;I just can&rsquo;t do it, that&rsquo;s all.
We&rsquo;ve got to find some other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rankin, flinging up his hands as if
he were flinging up the problem, &ldquo;all right; you
find the other way. I&rsquo;ve been here rackin&rsquo; what few
brains I&rsquo;ve got fer a week, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t think of any
other way. God knows I&rsquo;ve spent all I&rsquo;ve got as it
is.&rdquo; He settled back in his chair and plunged his
hands deep in his empty pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, Jim, and I appreciate it&mdash;but&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Garwood sat and thought intently an instant,
knitting his strong brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t tell you either, but I think I can
raise it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see you to-morrow morning. I think I
know of a place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Jerry,&rdquo; said Rankin, getting up; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care where you get it&mdash;jus&rsquo; so&rsquo;s you get it.
I only want to see you landed high an&rsquo; dry out of
the wet, my boy, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; And he hit Garwood
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, let me hold it fer you,&rdquo; he said a minute
later, when Garwood had picked up his overcoat,
heavy with its soaking in the rain.</p>

<p>Down in Chris Steisfloss&rsquo;s saloon as they stood
at the bar, and just as Garwood was ordering a
drink, Rankin pushed him aside and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you wait. Now Chris,&rdquo; he went on, addressing
the stolid man in the white apron, &ldquo;you
take a whisky glass an&rsquo; fill it with beer, mostly foam&mdash;same
as all your beers&mdash;an&rsquo; then put a spoonful
o&rsquo; that quinine on the foam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did as Rankin bade him, and when the
white powder was floating on the sparkling foam,
Rankin gave it to Garwood and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you swallow that, quick; you can&rsquo;t taste
it. Then you can have your whisky.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="XVI">XVI</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Garwood turned into the gate of his
home that night a weird feeling of detachment
came over him. As he looked
around the familiar yard every black bush, every
tree tossing its thinned boughs hopelessly in the
wind that blew the rain in sheets against the front
of the house, seemed to belong to some past toward
which he yearned, as an exiled identity. Half way
to the low stoop, the light in the sitting room
moved, the shadow of the drenched syringa bush
under the window wheeled across the yard, and
then the light disappeared, leaving the window
black. He knew his mother had heard his step,
for in another moment the hall transom leaped
bright, the door opened, a great golden beam
streamed out on the walk and he saw his mother&rsquo;s
gaunt figure standing in the doorway. She held the
lamp over her head and bent forward, shading her
old eyes to peer out into the darkness, and in another
instant he was beside her, and she was slamming
the door behind him, shutting out the rain and
the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, you&rsquo;re drenched to the skin, Jerome!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Run right up and change your
clothes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a night!&rdquo; He whisked
out his handkerchief and wiped his face, wet with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>the rain and moist with perspiration, for the whisky
and the rapid walk had heated him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how hoarse you are!&rdquo; the mother said,
wheeling his big body about and pushing him toward
the stairs. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your death of cold!
Haven&rsquo;t you been doing anything for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took a little quinine and whisky a while ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I smelt it on your breath, Jerome,&rdquo; his
mother said rather severely. She was &ldquo;temperance,&rdquo;
as she would have put it.</p>

<p>Garwood risked an uneasy laugh. He had never
been able, grown man that he was, to overcome
what he considered a boyish fear of his mother&rsquo;s
knowing he drank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t stand there!&rdquo; the mother said. &ldquo;Go
right upstairs and take those wet duds off this
minute! Have you had any supper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; is supper over?&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I just got the table cleared and the dishes
washed. But I&rsquo;ll get you something, by the time
you&rsquo;re into dry clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother to get anything, mother,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>She gave the lamp to her son, and as he went up
the stairs he heard her raking up the coals in the
kitchen stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he called, peremptorily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make
any fire; just something cold&mdash;that&rsquo;ll do for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go get your clothes off as I tell you!&rdquo; his
mother called in the tone of command mothers love
to use with children for whom they are continually
making sacrifices. When she had revived the dying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>fire, she hastened upstairs and laid out clean
under-garments for her son, and dry hose, and then,
forever busy, left him with an injunction &ldquo;just to
dress comfortable and not fix up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood, warm, dry and refreshed, felt a glow
of comfort as he went downstairs in his slippers.
His mother had the fire crackling, and the tea-kettle
rocking briskly on the stove, puffing its little
spouts of steam importantly. Beside it stood a pan,
with water almost boiling, and she had a skillet
heating. She was in the dining-room; Garwood
could hear the clatter of plates, and when she came
bustling with her tireless, wiry energy out into the
kitchen, he remained there, walking up and down,
gossiping with her in a way which, while she was
always undemonstrative, she entirely loved. As the
fire grew hotter and the kettle began to sing, the
kitchen became warm and cozy, and the man and
the mother felt a confidential charm in their surroundings
that they never found so much anywhere
as in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Garwood told his mother of his meetings during
the week, of the meals he had been compelled to
endure at the little country hotels, of his long rides
by night. But he did not talk to her of Emily, and
the old woman warily avoided the girl&rsquo;s name and
all topics that even by the remotest association
might suggest her. Mrs. Garwood was proud of
Emily, and while she gloried in that pride before
the women of her acquaintance she never let her
son see it; she rather distrusted her own footing in
the presence of the girl or of her name. More than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>all she longed that night to keep her son at home
with her, and she strained every nerve to do so.</p>

<p>The fragrance of the steaming coffee was filling
the room. She put some slices of bacon in the
skillet to fry&mdash;broiling did not form any part of her
culinary accomplishments&mdash;and after she had
dropped two eggs into the tin pan where the water
had long been bubbling, she commanded him to
hold his watch on them, as if they were about to
run a race. She cut the bread in great white slices;
she opened a glass of her jelly, a concession she
seldom made before winter, and she even found
for his dessert the half of an apple pie. When she
had poured her coffee off, she whisked the supper
on to the table; and before Garwood could stop her
she had run bareheaded out of the kitchen door
and was grinding up a pitcher of fresh water from
the old chain-pump in the yard. He called to her
to let him get it, though he made no move to deter
her, and as she rinsed out the pitcher and whirled
the rattling crank of the pump again, she called
out of the rainy darkness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you come out here! You&rsquo;ve got your
slippers on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He scolded her as she came stamping back into
the kitchen, the rain drops showing on her gray
hair, but she stilled his scoldings by reproaches
of her own for standing in the open door on such
a night and with such a cold.</p>

<p>The son repaid his mother&rsquo;s efforts by declaring
that he did not know how hungry he was until he
smelled her cooking again, and he made the eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>that looked fondly across the table glisten with a
brightness that seldom glowed in their dim depths,
by eating all the bacon she had fried, and both the
eggs, and then by sending her to cut more bread.
He urged her to share his meal, though he warned
her that if she did she would have to cook him
more bacon and boil him another egg. She
refused, though she implored him to let her
fry more bacon and boil the other egg, but
she did consent finally to drink a cup of coffee, in
the readiness American women always evince for
their national beverage. She said it did her good
to see him eat. &ldquo;Feed a cold and starve a fever,&rdquo;
she quoted. When he had eaten, he threatened
to help her wash the dishes, as he used to do when
he was a boy, but she declined this assistance also,
saying she was going to leave them for the hired
girl to do up in the morning. She had fears of his
escaping when he had eaten, but he pacifically
lighted a cigar and she allowed him to stroll out
of her sight into the sitting room.</p>

<p>Though she had said she was not going to wash
the dishes he heard her scrape the skillet and a
moment later, knock the coffee pot on the sink outside
the kitchen door, and he called to upbraid her
for breaking her promise to him. Under his admonitions
she hastened through her work, and when
she joined him in the sitting room she glanced at
his feet, as she entered, to reassure herself by finding
him still in slippers. He gave her a pang of
fear by observing, in the moment when their conversation
lagged, that he supposed he ought to go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>over and see Emily, but she said, appealing to his
affection by speaking of herself in the third person:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stay with mother to-night; it&rsquo;s been so long
since you were at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got out her sewing basket for her never
idle hands and as Garwood stretched himself in the
wooden rocking-chair his father had loved, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, all right; she doesn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m here
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she was content to sit and darn his socks
and look at him in the great silence of a mother&rsquo;s
love.</p>

<p>They sat there for a long time. She did not
know how to make conversation, and, remembering
the dislike for questions he had inherited from
his silent father, she feared to disturb him by asking
any. She was satisfied to have him with her.</p>

<p>Garwood remained silent until he had finished his
cigar, disliking to interrupt his own pleasure in it
by opening the subject that then was on his heart.
But at length he began to talk to her about his
campaign, and it was a stimulant to her pride to
hear his confidences. She was more pleased
than distressed when he spoke in a discouraged
tone of his prospects. She knew he was of a desponding
temperament, another heritage from his
father, and it pleased her to try to cheer him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;lected,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Your
mother&rsquo;s prayin&rsquo;, my son, and she has faith in her
prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>Garwood laughed, with a touch of the harsh
skepticism she was always combating in him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we need money just now, as much
as prayers,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money?&rdquo; she asked, pausing in her darning,
and looking up at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are legitimate expenses
in a campaign you know, that a candidate has to
meet.&rdquo; And then he told her what the legitimate
expenses were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the boys&mdash;Jim Rankin and some others&mdash;suggested
that I ought to go to Mr. Harkness,&rdquo;
he said, when he had finished. He had adroitly
calculated the effect this suggestion would have
upon her, and he was certain of her reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to Mr. Harkness, would they? Humph!&rdquo;
Her eyes blazed as she almost snorted this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
have them know if we are poor we&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo;
to be beholden to the Harknesses in any such way
as that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I told them,&rdquo; said the son,
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you told &rsquo;em just right!&rdquo; she added. She
returned to her darning, holding up the sock,
stretched over her extended fingers, before the
lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know whom to go to,&rdquo; Garwood
said presently, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got to go to somebody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you possibly get along somehow?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em you just ain&rsquo;t got any money to
give &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood gave a contemptuous &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>then, made impatient by her utter failure to comprehend
the grim necessity of a candidate&rsquo;s position
with election but a week away, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I just say I&rsquo;d got to have some?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mother don&rsquo;t pretend to know about politics.
Your pa never had anything to do with &rsquo;em,
you know.&rdquo; She hastened to say this in her mild
voice, to conciliate his petulance with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, mother,&rdquo; he rejoined; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a
ground-hog case with me. I&rsquo;ve got to meet my
assessments some way. It wouldn&rsquo;t be honourable
not to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched out his long legs and gazed into
the grate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to borrow of some one, I don&rsquo;t know
who.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slid farther down into his chair and crowded
his hands into his trousers&rsquo; pockets, a physical posture
at one with his mental attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was scowling, his face was long, and he said
this with the deep tone of a final and absolute
despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one will lend it to you,&rdquo; the mother said.
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t get so down-hearted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to know who!&rdquo; he said, casting a
challenge at her from his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, some o&rsquo; the banks&mdash;they loan money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed aloud, harshly, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The banks!&rdquo; he said, mocking her tone. &ldquo;The
banks! They&rsquo;d be likely to lend me any without
security, wouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jerome, don&rsquo;t get mad with mother,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d help you if she could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was silent; silent for a long time. She
looked up at him now and then, cautiously, but she
understood his humor, and she thought by the
knitting of his brows that he was deep in thought.
Out of his cogitations he came after a time, and
then to say, with a mild, hesitating approach to
their result:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can think of only one thing, mother, I might
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might borrow a little from the bank&mdash;and we
give a mortgage on the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother did not move. Her gray head was
bent over her sewing. The light of the lamp made
her hair glisten; he heard the sound of her thread
as she pulled her darning-needle regularly out to
arm&rsquo;s length. Presently, as he ventured to look
at her, he thought of how his father had toiled
to put this little roof over her head before the disease
which he knew was hastening his end should
bear him away; he thought of the comfort she had
always taken, during the long years she had worked
to keep him in school, in the thought that whatever
else came, she had a home, an asylum for every
stress and storm of life. She sewed on in the silence,
and he did not speak again, but waited for
her. And after awhile she spoke, without raising
her head:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, dear&rdquo;&mdash;he could not remember
when she had permitted herself the tender word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>before&mdash;&ldquo;what I promised your father before he
went away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood leaned toward her with his elbows on
his knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but this really isn&rsquo;t
serious, not that serious; it would be a small one,
and I&rsquo;m sure to be elected, and then I&rsquo;ll have a good
salary as congressman&mdash;five thousand a year&mdash;just
think! Why, it would only be for a couple of
months; I&rsquo;d get a sixty-day loan. I could easily
pay it off then; you&rsquo;d never know the difference.&rdquo;
He smiled in his own hopefulness. &ldquo;It seems a pity
to lose such a good chance as I&rsquo;ve got now for a
little thing like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not raise her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your father said, Jerome,&rdquo; she faltered, and
then he saw a tear fall on the pile of hose in her
lap, and, strangely enough, in such a moment, he
saw a pair of their servant girl&rsquo;s stockings&mdash;he
knew them because their splendor of color told
that they never belonged to his mother. &ldquo;And I,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;I&mdash;promised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother, just look here a minute&mdash;I
wouldn&rsquo;t ask anything out of the way of you,
would I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been a good son to me, Jerome,
and a good provider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t as if you were going to get a big
sum on it, or as if we had no chance of paying it
off right away. It won&rsquo;t be breaking your promise,
don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on with his smiling, specious reasoning,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>reassuring himself every minute, and finally
seeming to make an impression upon her, for she
said at last:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jerome, you&rsquo;re a man now, and you know
best about such things. You&rsquo;ll have to take care of
your old mother before long, anyway, till she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took off her spectacles and wiped away their
moisture on the stocking she was darning, and then
she raised her eyes, their pale depths dim with tears,
and through them she smiled at him. He got up
and kissed her, and she held him to her, pressing
his cheek close to her withered one, patting his
hands clumsily, awkwardly, for she had never had
time to cultivate the luxurious graces of affection.</p>

<p>She did not, however, give way long to her emotion.
She urged him to go to bed, because of his
cold, and in the new burst of affection the evening
had developed in his heart, he obeyed. She tucked
him in his bed as if he had been a little boy again,
and said good night.</p>

<p>He lay there a long time, warm, perspiring, comfortable,
his election as he felt at last assured. But
he could not get to sleep. For from his mother&rsquo;s
room there came to him the sound of her quavering,
aged voice, in hoarse whispers, and he knew
that she was kneeling by her bed, praying.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="XVII">XVII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ARWOOD found Rankin sitting in the lobby
of the Cassell House, stiff in the highly
glossed linen his wife decreed for his Sunday
wear, his face cleanly shaved and showing its
pink under the powder the barber had left on it.
He had had his hair cut, too, and his cropped curls,
because they had been combed by the barber, gave
him the appearance of having been trimmed and
made over in another fashion. He had got some
of the ashes of his cigar on his waistcoat, as he
lay deep in a big chair with the Sunday papers
piled in his lap, and when he noticed Garwood, he
also noticed the ashes, and in his haste to brush
them off, he could only wheeze out an inadequate
greeting between the teeth that clenched his cigar.</p>

<p>Garwood did not feel the satisfaction he had anticipated
for that moment, when he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim, you may rest easy, I can take care of
that little matter we were talking of last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Garwood spoke with a politician&rsquo;s generality,
Rankin, before he replied, glanced over his
shoulders with a politician&rsquo;s wariness which is like
the wariness of a hunted savage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right then,&rdquo; Rankin answered,
blinking his eyes because the smoke from his cigar
had persisted in creeping into them. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t have
any trouble about it, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, none to speak of,&rdquo; said Garwood. He
laughed, but it was a laugh with more of rue than
mirth in it. &ldquo;It only means a little more debt, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rankin, nipping the wet and ragged
end of his cigar with his teeth, &ldquo;so long as you
don&rsquo;t have to mortgage the roof over your head
you&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words of course struck a pain through Garwood&rsquo;s
heart, but he gave his laugh again as he
answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon it won&rsquo;t come to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve al&rsquo;ays done, Jerry,&rdquo; said
Rankin, leaning over in a more confidential attitude,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s this. I&rsquo;ve al&rsquo;ays drawed the line
at the little woman and the kids; I&rsquo;ve al&rsquo;ays said
I&rsquo;d never compromise them or their future, and I
say that so long&rsquo;s a man don&rsquo;t do that, he&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason that morning Rankin seemed to
be in a soft and tender mood, and showed a desire
to talk of his home and its interests. Perhaps it
was because it was Sunday, and his wife had been
dressing him for the day with as much maternal
solicitude as she had dressed his children. Garwood
would have preferred Rankin&rsquo;s harsher and
more careless note, and because it gave him a
chance to get away, was glad when he remembered
that he had promised his mother to go to church
with her. He knew how gratifying this would be
to her, for in her strict Sabbatarianism she had disliked
his going down town at all that day; and then,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>too, he had felt that it would be a politic thing to
do.</p>

<p>He went homeward, recalling, word by word, all
of his conversation with Rankin, feeling a little
hurt at what seemed to him Rankin&rsquo;s coldness,
troubled with suspicions and misgivings that he
ascribed to the influence of Rankin&rsquo;s strange manner,
and without the peace of mind he thought he
should feel, now that his election was assured.</p>

<p>He found his mother with her bonnet on, and her
misshapen hands gloved and folded, in anxious
waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time does church begin?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half-past ten, the last bell rings,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; her son exclaimed, as he hurriedly
snapped his watch lid shut, &ldquo;I thought it
was at eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady&rsquo;s face winced with a jealous resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; of the &rsquo;piscopalian church,&rdquo; she
answered significantly; &ldquo;they always does things
different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked to church while the bells were ringing,
the Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist
churches tolling their bells one after another, a
note at a time, each tolerantly waiting its turn,
though the different keys in which their bells were
pitched rang out in a sharp disharmony their
doctrinal distinctions. Far away over on the
East Side, Garwood heard the chimes of the Catholic
church, holding aloof from all this dissonance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>of the clamoring creeds, while the Episcopalians
had no bell in their church, disdaining with a fine
superior quality of respectability to enter into the
brazen polemics.</p>

<p>The last bell had just stopped ringing, and its
dying tones were still vibrating through the building
when they reached the Methodist church, and
were shown down the aisle to Mrs. Garwood&rsquo;s pew,
although there was a pretense of free pews in that
church. Garwood could feel the glances of the
congregation upon him as he took his seat, and he
liked the little distinction, although he had grown
used, in the last two months, to being the central
figure of public gatherings. He recalled how carefully
the Monday morning papers chronicled the
church goings of the presidential candidates with
the fact that the preacher had added something to
his sermon that pledged a providential interest in
the success of the nominee who had distinguished
that preacher&rsquo;s church with his presence, and Garwood
tried to conduct himself as a great
man should, or as he imagined he would appear
when, a little later, he should become a great man.
He bent his head during the prayer, not so low as
his mother did, but at an angle that would express
a dignified unworthiness to join in public prayer,
though giving the assurance at the same time of his
respect for it.</p>

<p>During the services, especially during the preaching,
Garwood had much time for thought and meditation.
His meditations were idle and incoherent,
running on Emily, and the afternoon he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>spend with her; on his campaign and its impending
close. Through them all ran a certain minor chord
of sadness and reproach, particularly when he
looked at his mother sitting there beside him, her
eyes raised behind their gold spectacles in the very
acme of respectful attention as she tried to pierce
the meaning the preacher sought to crowd into his
sermon without making it too long to offend the
Longworths, the rich family of the congregation,
who, striving to wear the impressive aspect of
prominence in the community, filled a whole pew.
Garwood found his thoughts hardly tolerable so
long as he allowed them to rest in the present. He
could grasp at happiness and comfort only when
they built on the surer, brighter future which soon
would open to him. He found it hard, however, to
keep them always building air castles; they persisted
in returning to the present, to Emily, to Rankin,
to the campaign, to the mortgage. He was depressed
and longed for the services to end. They
seemed to stretch themselves out interminably, with
prayers and hymns and anthems, with announcements
and collections, finally, after the sermon, with
the baptism of a crying child. He felt as when a
little boy he had squirmed during the long two
hours, and as a boy was glad when service was over&mdash;he
was particularly glad that it had not proved to
be communion Sunday, for that would have made
it necessary for him once more to face a moral
problem; to decide on a course of action; and he
was wearied with moral problems and decisions.</p>

<p>The heavy feeling that oppressed Garwood in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>church, the chill that checked the felicity he felt
himself now entitled to, remained with him. At
times he would forget and become happy, but as
soon as he was conscious that he was happy, he
would remember that there was some reason why
he should not be happy, and then his memory would
swiftly bring back to him the thing he had done.
By afternoon this constant recurrence irritated him,
and he half pitied himself, thinking it unjust that
he should be thus annoyed when he was so anxious
to be contented and at peace, especially after all
the sacrifices he had made to his mother&rsquo;s wishes
during the last sixteen hours. And so when he set
out in the clear, shining afternoon to go to Emily,
he resolved to throw off this feeling; to cast it from
him; to have done with it for all time. Physically
he expressed this resolve by the fling of his head,
and the way he set his shoulders back, holding them
high with the will to be all he wished to be.</p>

<p>The house-maid was out for her Sunday afternoon
holiday, and Emily herself swung back the
door in answer to Garwood&rsquo;s ring. The girl
smiled radiantly when she saw him and, with a lover&rsquo;s
pretense about her spiritual prescience of all
his movements, said she knew it was he at the door.
He told her that she had never looked so beautiful
before, and there was much of truth in this, for
she wore, with an effect of having shown it at
church for the first time that morning, a new fall
suit, the skirt of which vouched for the jacket that
had been laid aside for the greater comfort of a blue
silk bodice, which billowed modestly at her young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>breast, giving her an air of slightness and accentuating
the delicacy of her whole person. Her eyes
and cheeks were bright with health and her lover&rsquo;s
coming, so that her natural color, which made the
wearing of dark costumes an easy thing for her,
was thereby heightened.</p>

<p>In the moment they lingered in the hall, she laid
her soft hands on his shoulders, reaching up to him
with a smile of propitiation to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dade&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was pleased when he frowned his jealous
disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long&rsquo;s she going to stay?&rdquo; he said bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not long,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t stay when
she knows you&rsquo;re here. Why didn&rsquo;t you let me
know you were coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I came on a
telegram from Rankin, and I ought to go right out
again, only&mdash;I had to stay and see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She purred an instant in the embrace into which
he drew her and then quickly hushed him by pointing
toward the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Garwood had never known Dade Emerson,
though he had heard of her from Emily in those
confidences with which they tried to atone for the
years that had passed before love came to them, by
recounting in detail, little by little, all their happenings
and relations. Dade, to be sure, had impulsively
declared that she remembered Garwood as a
shock-headed boy whose short trousers came abjectly
below his knees, and had identified him to
Emily as the youth who had thrown a stone and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>hooted them as they were going homeward one day
from the Misses Lewis&rsquo;s school. Emily had gleefully
told this to Garwood and though he had recognized
the picture&rsquo;s truth, he was ashamed of it,
and had denied it altogether.</p>

<p>When they entered the drawing-room, and Emily
had presented Garwood, there was an instant&rsquo;s constraint,
born of Garwood&rsquo;s uneasiness in women&rsquo;s
society, an uneasiness he somehow contrived to
make pass for a Byronic contempt of it, to which
also contributed Emily&rsquo;s solicitude that her lover
should meet the approval of her friend.</p>

<p>Dade sat listlessly twirling a ring on her strong,
white finger, a silver ring of curious, antique workmanship
that helped the foreign effect she sought
in her personality, but when, through her lashes
she saw Emily gazing at Garwood with a sudden
access of fondness, she rather coldly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ah standing for the borough, I believe, ah
you not, Mistah Gahwood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m running for Congress, if that&rsquo;s what you
mean,&rdquo; replied Garwood with an uncontrollable
bluntness that he regretted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; that is what you call it, isn&rsquo;t it? How
int&rsquo;resting you must find it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood laughed in an effort to find ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find it pretty hard work,&rdquo; he sighed. Emily
noted the sigh, and pressed the hand she somehow
found between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all worn out, Dade,&rdquo; she explained, and
the sense of possession her tone implied put all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>three on an easier footing. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how
hard our political leaders have to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be elected?&rdquo; asked Dade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be elected,&rdquo; said Garwood, yielding himself
to the pillows that were piled near him. &ldquo;And
no sooner are we elected once than we have to begin
fixing up our fences for a second term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fixing up yoah fences?&rdquo; said Dade, wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a political phrase,&rdquo; explained Emily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have so many of them,&rdquo; said Dade, &ldquo;and
they ah all so unintelligible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must strike a foreigner as peculiar,&rdquo; said
Garwood. &ldquo;I had never thought of that before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a fo&rsquo;eigneh, you know,&rdquo; the girl
protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re pretty near it,&rdquo; said Emily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
lived abroad all her life, you know&mdash;nearly,&rdquo; she
explained aside to Garwood.</p>

<p>Garwood was pleased that the conversation had
taken a turn which he could follow. With strange
women he found small talk impossible as all men
must who are not versed in the banalities of women&rsquo;s
intercourse, though they indulge themselves
for hours in the trivialities of men&rsquo;s gossip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never thought of it before,&rdquo; said Garwood,
&ldquo;but most of our political phrases savor of
our young agricultural life; perhaps I would better
say our pioneer life. There&rsquo;s &lsquo;log-rolling,&rsquo; for instance,
and &lsquo;stump speaking,&rsquo; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And setting the prairies on fiah,&rdquo; Dade added.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>&ldquo;I saw in the papah the othah day that you weare
doing that&mdash;on the stump, they said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood laughed again, naturally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was one of Rankin&rsquo;s inspired tales, no
doubt. Rather a mixture of figures, too, setting the
prairies on fire from the stump, don&rsquo;t you think?
And you probably saw as well, that some of the Indians
over in Moultrie have their knives out, and
are after my scalp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is more than agricultural, or pioneerish,&rdquo;
said Emily; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s actually savage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite deliciously American,&rdquo; said Miss Emerson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And one of the few things the papers say of me
that are true!&rdquo; sighed Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of that,&rdquo; said Emily loyally;
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t there just a little truth in the story about
your setting the prairies on fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood laughed, the superior laugh of a man
alone with women. He liked this political conversation
which he could so easily dominate, quite as
much as he liked Emily&rsquo;s frank acquiescence before
Miss Emerson in her position as his affianced bride.
It gave him such a sweet assurance of security in
one relation at least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a candidate never
does know any more about his own campaign than
a bridegroom does about the preparations for his
own wedding. To him it all seems to be going one
way; he sees nothing but friendly faces and hears
nothing but friendly cheers, and he goes to bed the
night before election almost hoping that his opponent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>may get a few votes just to console him,
though he doesn&rsquo;t see where the votes are to come
from. The morning after he wakes up to wonder
where his own votes all went to. It&rsquo;s always a
shock of surprise to the defeated man.&rdquo; He paused
to enjoy the effect of his little speech upon the
girls, and then resumed: &ldquo;If you want to know
how my campaign is really coming on you&rsquo;ll have
to ask Jim Rankin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this Mistah Rankin?&rdquo; asked Dade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Emily, turning toward her companion
with a superiority of her own, &ldquo;you remember&mdash;I
told you about him the other day. You really
should see him, he&rsquo;s the funniest man and the most
interesting. He is managing the campaign for Jerome.
He just worships Jerome; I believe he&rsquo;d die
for you, don&rsquo;t you, Jerome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard him say he&rsquo;d go through&mdash;ah&mdash;hell
and high water for me,&rdquo; said Garwood with the
keen enjoyment that comes from vicarious profanity
quoted in a presence where, stripped of its quotation
marks, it would be inadmissible.</p>

<p>The two girls exclaimed, though they enjoyed
the risk of it, and sat while Garwood celebrated
Rankin&rsquo;s virtues as a friend and as a politician.
When he found room for more quotable profanity
Emily laid her palm lightly over his mouth, and at
this demonstration of affection Dade rose and said
significantly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it high time I was going and leaving
you alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a little show of protest, but she went,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>Garwood standing in the middle of the room wondering
if the proprieties demanded that he accompany
Emily as she escorted Dade to the door; but
he withdrew into the security of that dignity which
stood him in such good stead in all social crises,
and bowed as if the retiring girl were an audience
or a jury. The two girls lingered in the hall longer
than Garwood thought necessary, though he lost
his objection in the satisfaction of the conviction
that they were discussing him.</p>

<p>Garwood, of course, stayed to that unclassified
meal which is served on Sunday evenings. The repast
which Emily in the absence of the servants
laid herself, was without formality, and the girl
artfully contrived to hide from him the extra preparation
that was represented by the bowl of salad
she brought forth and set in the midst of the white
linen and all the glitter of the table service. Garwood
and Mr. Harkness talked of men&rsquo;s topics during
the meal and Emily was silent with the silence
of the woman in her serving, though her eyes
gleamed at the comradeship she thought she recognized
in the two men. She did not know how thoroughly
the real thought of each man was with
her, though Garwood from time to time reflected
on the comparison that might be made between the
plainness of his mother&rsquo;s table on Sunday evenings
and the elegance of the one at which he now expanded
himself.</p>

<p>It was late when he went home that night. As
he left he told Emily, in their lengthened farewells,
that it had been the happiest Sunday he had ever
known.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="no-break" id="XVIII">XVIII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>VERYWHERE the campaign was closing,
as the newspapers said, in a blaze of glory.</p>

<p>From their headquarters in New York the
managers of the two great parties were issuing
their last impossible claims, their last careful instructions,
their last solemn warnings. Partisan
hatred raged in every hamlet in the land, and the
whole nation was given over to the last passion of
its quadrennial tragedy of personal ambitions.</p>

<p>Down in the Thirteenth Congressional District
of Illinois, Garwood was making his final tour of
the seven counties, speaking many times daily. He
was disheveled and bedraggled, he went without
shaving, without sleeping, much of the time without
food. He had turned into a mere smiling
automaton, that could drink, talk in a husky voice,
and go on and on. Insensible to bodily fatigue and
discomfort, his only physical sensation was a constant
longing for tobacco, and he smoked all the
time.</p>

<p>At home, Rankin had finished all his plans. He
had completed a second poll, which he had had
taken by school districts, and the thousand dollars
Garwood had given him on the Monday morning
before starting on his final campaigning tour
he was hoarding for election day. His own
confidence was such that, when Mr. Harkness, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>the interest he could not conceal, one day asked
about the outlook, he was able to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right if they don&rsquo;t buy us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin had determined that Garwood&rsquo;s campaign
should close with a splendid spectacle of fire
in his home town. He had roused the county committee
to a frenzy of action, he had compelled the
candidates on the county ticket to make one final
contribution to the campaign fund, and as Garwood&rsquo;s
share of the great meeting Rankin engaged
a band, and kept this action so constantly before his
fellow-committeemen that their own efforts seemed
paltry and puny in comparison with his. When
the last Sunday night came, and but one more day
remained, he said to his sleepy wife as he came
home far in the chill hours of the morning:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mamma, we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em licked&mdash;but they
don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily celebrated the evening of the meeting by
asking Mrs. Garwood with Dade and her mother
to supper, after which they were to be driven to
the opera house early enough to obtain good seats
for the speaking. Emily had hoped to have Garwood
himself there, but at the last moment a telegram
came from him at Mt. Pulaski saying that
his train was late and he would have to go directly
from the station to the opera house to be in time
for his speech. Dade came and brought her
mother&rsquo;s excuses, though not their querulousness,
and by her affectations troubled Mrs. Garwood,
already constrained by the embarrassment of a
meal too elaborate for her comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>The supper was hardly over when the preliminary
pounding of a bass drum came to their ears,
and Emily and Dade fluttered out on the veranda
as excitedly as the little boys who raced up and
down the avenue shouting that the parade was
coming, and saluting it with premature fanfaronades
on their tin horns. Sangamon Avenue did
not twinkle with Japanese lanterns this night as it
had on the night of the Bromley meeting, for Garwood&rsquo;s
social position was not that of Bromley&rsquo;s,
and the rich therefore did not so readily identify
themselves with his cause, but the boys were bipartisan
and now and then the big flags that swung
over the lawns all summer were illumined by the
red fire which some youngster, unable to restrain
his impatience, had set off. Occasionally a line of
torches would undulate across the avenue several
blocks away, and then the wild announcements of
the boys would arouse even their waiting elders on
the porches; but there were many of these false
alarms, so many, that Dade declared that the
parade was a failure and would not pass that way.</p>

<p>But at last it came. They heard the strains of a
band swelling loud as some distant corner was
turned, then, in the darkness of the November
night, far away through the trees, they caught the
lick of a torch&rsquo;s flame, then another and another,
until they made a river of yellow fire that poured
itself down the street from curb to curb, rising and
falling as the marchers&rsquo; feet kept time to the
punctuated rolling of the drums. Along the sidewalks
streamed a crowd of boys, and men like boys,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>the same that had trudged through the dust beside
Garwood&rsquo;s carriage that hot day in August, the
same that had flanked the Bromley parade a few
weeks before.</p>

<p>The girls had been followed to the veranda by
Mr. Harkness and Mrs. Garwood, and as the old
man and the old woman pressed forward in an
interest they disliked to own, the two girls clutching
each other at last in a definite embrace teetered
on the very edge of the steps, their teeth chattering
with nervousness. Jasper had driven the carriage
around and stood at the heads of the horses, who
pricked their ears towards the oncoming mass of
men and fire, and gazed at it with startled eyes,
jerking their heads now and then and blowing
through their soft sensitive nostrils.</p>

<p>The procession had drawn so near that it was
possible to distinguish the details that made the
mass, the four policemen, in double-breasted sack
coats who had been announced as a platoon; the
grand marshal of the parade, decked out bravely in
rosettes and patriotic bunting, trying to sit his
buggy-horse with the military seat; the flag bearer,
with bent back, straining under his load; the faces
of the marchers themselves red and unfamiliar in
the glare that lit them up, like faces transfigured
in the glamour that saves a tableau from contempt.</p>

<p>There were clubs from each ward, uniformed in
the oil-cloth capes and caps of that day, with wide
intervals between their sets of fours, and eked out
by small boys in the rear ranks; there was a company
of railroad men&mdash;at least their transparencies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>said they were railroad men&mdash;wearing overalls, and
swinging lighted lanterns, and these were vouchsafed
most patronizing applause from the lawns
and verandas, as if they were nobly sacrificing
themselves for the salvation of their nation. The
lines were well formed, and marched with an effect
of military precision, though the procession had to
stop now and then to mark time and dress its
intervals.</p>

<p>When the marching hosts saw the Harkness
house all ablaze from top to bottom they recognized
their candidate&rsquo;s relation to the first quality of the
town by venting a sentimental cheer, waving their
torches above their heads, and throwing the flames
into the air. Then the grand marshal, holding on
to pommel and cantle, twisted his huge haunches
in the saddle, and shouted some mighty order,
which, though wholly unintelligible to everybody,
and to the marchers more than anybody, at once
created a vast commotion down the fiery line. His
hoarse words, or some hoarse words, were repeated,
tossed as it were from one throat to another, the
marshal&rsquo;s aides galloped wildly up and down until
at last the torches began to dance in varying directions
as the column executed some complex
man&oelig;uver that wrought a change in its formation.
And then the marshal, in a way that no doubt
reminded himself of a Napoleon, or a Grant, turned
about in his saddle, squeezed his plodding horse&rsquo;s
ribs with his spurless heels, and, under his slouch
hat, glanced from left to right like Stonewall
Jackson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>At the same moment a drum-major shrilled
his whistle, and twirled his baton, a cornet trilled
and the band began to play:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;When Johnny comes marching home again,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Hurrah, hurrah!&rdquo;</span></div></div>

<p>The two girls emotionally trod a dancing measure,
and then, because of the smell of saltpeter,
the snorts of horses, the shouts of men, the red
and white ripple of the flags that went careering
by in smoke and flame, some strange suggestion of
the war our political contests typify, in spirit and
symbol at least, was borne to them, until they felt
what they conceived to be patriotic thrills coursing
up and down their spines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love the dear old flag, after all,
Dade?&rdquo; cried Emily, above the noise. The girl
pressed her companion&rsquo;s waist in response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s a rebel tune they&rsquo;re playing,&rdquo; said
old Mrs. Garwood, dubiously wagging her head in
its bonnet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re all one now!&rdquo; said Mr. Harkness,
and then blew his nose in chagrin at this show of
feeling.</p>

<p>They stood and shivered in the cold night air and
watched the parade go by, read the transparencies
with their boasting inscriptions, praised the various
regalia of the marchers, kept time to the singing
of the bugles and the going of the drums, and
cheered when fifty men from Cotton Wood township,
wearing coon-skin caps and followed by dogs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>trotted by on their heavy plow horses. Finally
a rabble of boys and negroes brought up the rear,
snatching extinguished torches, half-burned roman
candles or sticks of red fire to make a little celebration,
and the parade had passed.</p>

<p>When Emily and her party reached the opera
house, the sidewalk was cumbered with the loafers
who always gathered there when the place of
amusement was opened, and people were streaming
up the wide stairway into the hall. Mr. Harkness
led the women to seats toward the front of the
house, where they joined the scattered folk already
sitting there, fanning themselves in the air that was
overheated by the blazing gas jets, talking, laughing,
whiling away the long time they had to wait
for their entertainment to begin. Up in the dim
and dusty gallery boys were improving an opportunity
of liberty by clattering over the wooden
benches, calling to one another, whistling, dinning
the night with the noises boys love.</p>

<p>The stage was furnished with a table, and on it
were the white pitcher and the waiting glass from
which orators quench their ever-raging thirst. The
table&rsquo;s legs were hidden by a flag, in the folds of
which was a picture of the candidate for president.
The stage had been set with the theater&rsquo;s gray-walled
drawing-room scene&mdash;the one with the frescoed
curtains and tassels&mdash;and an effort had been
made to warm the cold and cheerless setting of so
many domestic comedies and kingly tragedies by a
further use of flags and bunting and a few pictures.
Among them was one of Garwood, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>Emily recognized after study, and resented, because
of the fierce cast in the eye, and the aged
droop to the mouth. They left old Mrs. Garwood
in the dark as to the identity of that portrait.</p>

<p>The stage was filled with wooden chairs, ashen-white
in their unpainted newness. The vice-presidents,
for whom these chairs were intended, had
not arrived, but presently they began to tiptoe
awkwardly across the stage, and then seat themselves,
troubled about the disposition of their feet
before the unaccustomed footlights. They coughed
into their hands from time to time, and were
obviously glad when some black-garbed companion
came to share their misery and let them pretend
the ease they sought by talking to him. The stage
filled, and some began looking at their watches.
At eight o&rsquo;clock the hall was full; the meeting was
certain to be a success anyway. Ten minutes more
passed by. The committee arrived and seated itself
on the stage. The Glee Club came and cleared its
four throats. Outside the noise of the disbanding
parade could be heard and then the rush of the
marchers to get indoors. The band clambered up
to the gallery, ousted a whole section to make a
fitting place for itself down by the railing, then at
half-past eight began to play a medley of national
airs, and though the strains of America, Columbia,
The Red, White and Blue, Dixie, Marching
Through Georgia and Yankee Doodle filled the
theater, the atmosphere was charged with the suspense
of long waiting.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while the band was playing, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>wave of excitement swept over the audience;
there was a commotion at the door, a shuffle of
feet, a scraping of chairs. The vice-presidents
craned their necks to peer over the black-coated
shoulders in front of them, people ceased their fanning
and twisted about in their seats to look, a
rattle of clapping hands broke forth, a cheer arose,
the floor began to tremble and vibrate beneath
stamping feet, and then the building shook with
heavy applause.</p>

<p>And all at once Emily saw Jim Rankin, rubicund,
his curls sticking to his wet forehead,
smiling always, leading the way up a side aisle,
and behind him Garwood, his hat in his hand, his
overcoat on his arm. She saw him run his free
hand through his hair to loosen it, then shake it
back with that royal toss of the head she knew so
well, and stride on, his face white, his eyes dark,
his mouth firmly closed on the level line of his
lips.</p>

<p>The house rocked with the storm of cheers, with
cries of his name, but he marched straight on, behind
his smiling Rankin, who responded to the
greetings of men who rose from chairs or pressed
themselves flat against the walls to give room in the
aisle. The little party disappeared behind the
scenes, and the ovation lulled.</p>

<p>Emily felt her throat close and feared the tears
that already moistened her eyes. She tried to compose
her features, she crushed Dade&rsquo;s arm in her
fingers, then she stole a glance at those about her.
Everybody was looking at Garwood, everybody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>save one, her father; he was looking at her, while
Mrs. Garwood, having found her handkerchief,
held it in her work-worn hands just as it had come
from the iron that afternoon, fresh and clean, keeping
her eyes fixed on the stage, watching for her
boy to appear again, while tears rolled unchecked
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>And then Emily heard Dade whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wondah why they didn&rsquo;t come in by the stage
entrance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin and Garwood had stepped on the stage,
and the applause had broken forth again. Garwood
had taken out a big white handkerchief and
was wiping his brow. He was smiling now, and
greeting the vice-presidents of the meeting, who
stretched their bodies across their neighbors&rsquo; knees
to shake his hand. Rankin, too, was mopping his
forehead, and he had his watch out. As soon as he
saw that Garwood was seated, he stepped to the
front of the stage, his red face round with smiles.
Then suddenly his smile died, his face blanched,
and he tapped the decorated table with the gavel
that lay on it. He took a swallow of the water
he supposed was in the glass, and at last his voice
came:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends an&rsquo; fellow citizens,&rdquo; he said, though
not many could hear him, &ldquo;will you come to order,
an&rsquo; I now have the honor of interducin&rsquo; to you
Judge Bickerstaff, who will preside at this meetin&rsquo;
as permanent chairman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin retired amid a volley of hand-claps,
which the rotund judge, advancing to the front of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>the stage, buttoning his frock coat about him,
thought were meant for him. He bowed ponderously,
and then, with one hand on the table beside
him, began the platitudinous speech of the permanent
chairman. The people bore with him in that
divine patience to which the American public has
schooled itself under this oft-recurring ordeal, and
even gave him some perfunctory applause. But
the quality of the applause was spontaneous only
when he reached the place where he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I now have the very great honor and the very
great pleasure of introducing to you your next
congressman, the Honorable Jerome B. Garwood.&rdquo;
Jerry arose at the sound of his own name and,
advancing to the front of the stage, stood there
calm and composed until the applause died away;
stood there calm and composed until the silence
came and deepened. He looked over the whole
audience, at the galleries even, and then his eye
traveled unerringly to the spot where his own sat.
He looked at his mother, gazing up at him through
her dim spectacles, at Dade who smiled, at Mr.
Harkness who was stern, at last at Emily. Their
eyes met, and as Emily&rsquo;s fell she heard his voice
in low, musical modulation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And his last speech of the campaign began.</p>

<p>Whenever in Grand Prairie they discuss Jerry
Garwood&rsquo;s oratory, they shake their heads and say
that he made the speech of his life that last night
before election.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="XIX">XIX</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was election night in Chicago and already a
great crowd thronged the Webster House, a
crowd, as was perhaps fitting in a land where
the avocation of every man is governing, composed
wholly of men, although in one corner of the
balcony that ran around the rotunda of the old
hotel there were several women. The splendor that
had been produced in their dress by the competition
of a public dining-room, proclaimed them as
regular boarders, and as an additional evidence of
their lot in life, they had that air of detachment
from their husbands which most hotel ladies soon
or late come to wear. As they leaned over the
balcony, their jewels and teeth and white hands
flashed nervously, as if they shared the excitement
of the crowd below. For them, as it might for any
one, the great crowd possessed a never failing interest.
Looking down they saw it continually in
uneasy motion like a herd of milling cattle. Here
and there were nucleated groups of men engaged in
belated political argument or in hedging political
bets, here and there some tired outcast glad of the
temporary warmth and light, shivered in ragged
summer garments that the long day&rsquo;s rain had
drenched, here and there some messenger boy
dodged along, here and there some reporter elbowed
his way through the crowd, and here and
<span class="pagenum2 hide" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>there a wide track was marked by the more important
progress of some politician. Over the head
of the crowd hung a stratus of tobacco smoke, and
all the while arose a multitudinous voice, laughing,
swearing, cheering. Constantly arms were flung
into the air, and sometimes a hat went spinning up
to the dark skylight on which a November rain
endlessly drummed.</p>

<p>Up the wide staircase and down the hall, carpeted
with canvas ever since the campaign opened,
men trailed their dripping umbrellas, passing in
and out of the suite of parlors where the state
central committee had its headquarters. The
outer rooms were crowded with men, their garments
steaming from the rain, their faces dripping
with perspiration, their dirty fingers holding
chewed cigars. Some of them were drunk and
quarrelsome, and now and then the policeman who
leaned against the doors spoke confidentially to
these, deprecating the trouble he could so easily
bring upon them. The desk of the secretary was
closed and wore an air of having been closed finally.
On the floor were piles of blank nominating petitions
that never would be used, bundles of newspapers
that never would be read, and heaps of campaign
literature that never would be distributed.
In a corner where three or four sample torches
stood was a pile of lithographs, and from them the
faces of candidates, as if they still posed before
the people, looked out with the same solemn expressions
they had worn for the campaign. Outside,
from a wire that was stretched to the building
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>on the opposite side of the street, the big campaign
banner could be heard booming in the wind.</p>

<p>In the innermost of the committee&rsquo;s apartments
only a few men had been admitted, men who that
year, at least, were the managers of the party&rsquo;s
policies in the state. In this room was Garwood.
He had voted early that morning and had then
taken a train for Chicago, in order to be in the very
center of the night&rsquo;s excitement.</p>

<p>As he sat there in a deep leather chair he could
hear the ring of cab-horses&rsquo; hoofs on the glistening
cobble stones of the street below; the shouts
of election night, now and then the blare of a tin
horn. From Washington Street, two blocks away,
a cheer, mellowed pleasantly by the distance, came
from the crowd before the newspaper offices, where
the returns were being flashed upon screens, and
from below always ascended that endless roar.
From the entresol a deep voice was reading the
bulletins to the multitude in the rotunda. Garwood
caught snatches of what the voice was reading:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four hundred and twenty-nine precincts in
Brooklyn and Kings County show net gains&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once he heard the inevitable news that Mississippi
had gone overwhelmingly Democratic, and
Vermont overwhelmingly Republican, and then the
quadrennial laugh with which these foregone conclusions
are received and the quadrennial cheers
with which partisanship dutifully celebrates them.
But, though he heard, he was scarcely conscious of
it all; it sounded far away to him and strange. His
thoughts lay too deep for these objective manifestations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>The crisis of his life, he felt, had come.
He was with men who like himself were candidates,
or else the managers of candidates, and yet he felt
that the result of the election meant more to him
than it did to them.</p>

<p>He had risked all on this campaign; he had
abandoned his practice, staked his reputation, spent
all his money, gone in debt, all he was or had was
involved&mdash;Emily with the rest. He felt that if he
were defeated she would be lost to him. He
looked at Colonel Warfield, the chairman of the
state executive committee, sitting at the table in
the center of the room, a pad of paper before
him, idly turning a pencil over and over in his
fingers as he considered the import of the latest
returns. Garwood wondered if he were really as
calm as he appeared. He looked at the others in
the room, laughing and joking as they were&mdash;no,
it could not matter to them as it did to him; they
had position, money, influence; politics was to
them a kind of recreation. They lolled in chairs,
smoking at their ease, not caring to anticipate the
strain of the long, uncertain hours of the night,
but content to sit in silence with their heads thrown
back, trying to blow rings of smoke to the ceiling.
Once Parrish said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like waiting for a jury, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said some one else, &ldquo;but, thank God, this
is a jury that can&rsquo;t hang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; said old General Williams, who
had been in Congress for twenty years, representing
a safe district that he considered his by divine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>right, &ldquo;but it can stay out a long time. I remember,
once&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The danger of Williams&rsquo;s reminiscence was
averted by the click of the telegraph instrument.
The operator seized his stylus and began to write
rapidly. Warfield took the new bulletin from the
telegrapher&rsquo;s outstretched hand and studied it with
knitted brows. He read it aloud finally, and then
commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that gain keeps up in New York he&rsquo;ll come
down to Harlem bridge with less than seventy
thousand. It&rsquo;ll give us the state and the presidency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laid his pencil down and lighted a cigar, but
he did not relax his interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; he said a moment later,
spreading a piece of yellow flimsy over a white
sheet, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s one from Springfield; says returns
from thirty counties show net gains over two years
ago of eleven per cent. Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;&lsquo;In these counties,&rsquo;
he read, &lsquo;Chatham polls forty-three thousand
one hundred and seventy-nine. Norton, for state
treasurer, carried the same counties two years ago
by seventeen thousand two hundred and thirty-six.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men in the room stirred with a pleasing
excitement. Several of them began to talk again,
but the colonel said rather peremptorily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait! Here&rsquo;s some West Side news,&rdquo;&mdash;Newman,
who was standing for the Fourth Congressional
District, arose as the chairman read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three of the five wards comprising the Fourth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>Congressional District, the Eighth, the Ninth, and
the Nineteenth, give Newman eleven thousand
nine hundred and thirty-eight, Kenyon five thousand
six hundred and forty-seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Newman drew a long, full breath, and smiled
complacently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will the other wards go, John?&rdquo; asked
Parrish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all right. I carried the Eleventh by
a hundred and fifty-six two years ago,&rdquo; said Newman,
speaking with the accuracy with which a man
remembers his own majorities, &ldquo;and lost the
Twelfth by sixteen ninety-four, but I can give him
both of them and beat him out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood envied him keenly.</p>

<p>The operator was writing furiously now, and
kept his left arm, with a despatch dangling in his
fingers, almost continually stretched over the back
of his chair toward Warfield. The colonel made
his calculations rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are, General,&rdquo; he said to Williams
after awhile, and the white-bearded old man took
a despatch from him and carefully adjusted his
glasses. Then he hitched his chair up to the table,
cleared a place for his elbows, took some paper and
began to make figures of his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;I claim my
election by a majority of four thousand votes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was your majority two years ago?&rdquo; asked
Milton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said the old man, looking at Milton
as if he were betraying a culpable ignorance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>&ldquo;three thousand two hundred and ninety-six. Don&rsquo;t
you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; lied Milton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems popular in his district, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; whispered
Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Popular! No one can beat the old blatherskite.
Wish he had to run in my district once!&rdquo; Milton
spoke out of the bitterness the fierce contests of a
close district had worked in him. Just then a
number of reporters, moving in a body like a committee,
came to interview Colonel Warfield.</p>

<p>The colonel was thoughtful for a moment, and
then, smiling, he said: &ldquo;You probably know more
than I about it, but you can say for me that at
eleven o&rsquo;clock&rdquo;&mdash;he looked at his watch&mdash;&ldquo;basing
my calculations on incomplete returns from seventy-five
counties in the state, I claim the election
of Governor Chatham and the entire state ticket
by thirty-three thousand majority.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These others have scored already,&rdquo; said Anthony,
the secretary of the committee, waving at
General Williams, at Milton and at Newman the
corn-cob pipe for which he was famous all over the
state, &ldquo;all except Garwood there; he&rsquo;ll be in after
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside the noise was growing louder. They
could hear cheering from the rotunda, and in the
streets the crowds pouring out of the theater added
to the din. The noise had a new quality of wildness
in it that comes with the approach of midnight.
Schreiber, who had been put on the state ticket
for auditor because of his German name, had long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>ago claimed his own election by a safe majority,
and had made many trips down to the bar. He was
a fat man, plainly a connoisseur of Rhine wines;
and you might almost have said he was humid, so
moist was his rosy skin. He did not emit a German
&ldquo;Hoch!&rdquo; as would have befitted his personality,
but he continually boomed forth pleasantries,
congratulating the other successful candidates. But
from these general felicitations Garwood was excluded.
For an hour his hopes had been sinking.
Rankin had promised to telegraph as soon as he
had anything definite, but no word had come from
him. Though the returns from down the state
were coming in rapidly those from his own district
had been meager, and from what he already knew
he was convinced that he was running behind the
head of the ticket, both national and state. It
seemed to be well established by midnight that his
party had swept both the state and the nation, and
he seemed to be the only one thus far left out. He
pitied himself, he began to feel that the open triumph
of the successful ones about him was indelicate
and in bad taste; he felt that they should show
him more consideration. But they seemed to have
forgotten him in the realization of their own joy,
and Garwood could only smile grimly at the irony
of it all.</p>

<p>At midnight whistles blew all over the city, as if
it were New Year&rsquo;s, and just then Larry O&rsquo;Neil
came in, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em, Cook County&rsquo;s ours by fifty
thousand. Beats hell, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How are they feeling down at the Grand?&rdquo;
asked Anthony. The headquarters of the other
committee were at the Grand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ve shut up down there,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;and gone home. They seen it &rsquo;as no use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Warfield, laying down his pencil as
if he had no further need for it, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a landslide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At one o&rsquo;clock the telegraph instrument ceased
its chatter and the telegraph operator began to unroll
his little package of lunch. As the odor of the
buttered bread and the cold meat he spread on a
clean sheet of paper before him became perceptible
in the room, the men there felt for the first time
that night the pangs of hunger, and Colonel Warfield
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to our going down to the caf
and having a bite to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down in the caf, the men grouped themselves
about two tables which Warfield told the head
waiter to place end to end, and the meal he ordered
soon became a banquet. As they sat there talking
in excited tones, laughing at old stories of by-gone
campaigns, laughing even at the defeats of by-gone
campaigns, as they could afford to now, many men
passing through stopped to congratulate Warfield,
to slap him on the shoulder, and call him &ldquo;Good
boy!&rdquo; as if he had done it all. And as he thought
of the four years of that influence at Springfield
his position as the chairman who had directed the
campaign would give him, his inscrutable smile
expanded into one of great content. They were
happy at that table, all of them looking forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>to days of power, all save Garwood, who sat gloomy
and silent, drinking more than he ate, and drinking
more than he felt he ought. Once Warfield noticed
his despondency, and whispered to him in his
kind-hearted way:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up, old man. You&rsquo;ll pull through.
And if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll see that you&rsquo;re taken care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sympathy of the chairman&rsquo;s tone, more than
the promise he made, touched Garwood, but down
in his heart he felt a soreness. It was hard to see
them all successful and be alone doomed to defeat.
A place in the state administration, on some board,
even on the board of railroad and warehouse
commissioners, would hardly satisfy him now. He
had longed to go to Congress, and then, the vindication
he looked for meant more than all the rest.
And Emily&mdash;he thought of her and could have
wept. He felt himself more and more detached
from the scene. The table, the mirrors, the lights
of the caf, the laughing men, the rushing waiters,
the shuffle of the crowd in the lobby above, the
cries in the street outside, the toots of tin horns,
the companies of crazy men marching aimlessly
around and around, howling the names of candidates,
all sounded as remote and strange as if he
had no more a part in it.</p>

<p>The night waned, the noise changed, but did not
cease. It told of a decrease in the numbers in the
lobby, but the sounds were wilder. Men were making
a night of it. As in a dream Garwood heard
some one say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little woman down in Rock Island
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>who&rsquo;d like to hear from me. I must wire my
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Garwood thought of a telegram he might
have sent, had things gone differently. He thought
of a girl down in Grand Prairie, but now&mdash;it was
all so changed!</p>

<p>He stole away and sought his room. He went
to the window, pulled back the curtain and looked
down into Randolph Street. The rain had ceased,
but still the big campaign banner flapped clumsily.
The chill of dawn was in the air, a cold wind blew
in from the lake. Across the way the court house
and city hall loomed in the fog; in their shadow
he saw the jaded horses at the cab stand drooping
their noses to their crooked knees; the cable began
to buzz in its slot; far over the gloomy roofs the
sky was tinged with the pallor of coming day&mdash;then
suddenly a long shaft of brilliant light striking
across the sky startled him with a nameless
terror. The shaft rose slowly until it pointed
straight upward, then three times it swept a vast
arc down to the eastern horizon. And Garwood
remembered&mdash;it was the search-light which the
<i>Courier</i> had announced would signal the success of
Garwood&rsquo;s party. He recalled the day at Lincoln.
The great man and all the rest, as they went to bed
in the dawn of that November morning, were safe
in triumphant victory, while he alone&mdash;</p>

<p>He heard the heavy, mature voice of some early
newsboy:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extry! Toimes, Tribune, Her&rsquo;ld, an&rsquo; Courier!
&rsquo;Lection!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="XX">XX</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Garwood awoke, he opened his eyes
in darkness. The room was cold. He
heard the harsh Nottingham curtains stirring
in the breeze that came in at the windows, an
autumnal breeze that had only the chill of autumn
and none of the crispness and woodland odors
that he would have found in it down in Grand
Prairie. Instead, it was laden with the soot
and dirt of the city, and it could not dissipate the
heavy quality taken on by the air of a room
that had long been slept in. He could hear
the jolting of trucks on the cobble stones, the trudge
and shuffle of thousands of feet on the sidewalk,
the clank of the cable cars scraping around the
loop, and, punctuating the roar of the city, the
cries of the newsboys. Garwood slowly regathered
his senses, and lay in the moment that comes before
memory brings back individuality and life, trying
to fathom a deep sense of something wrong. Then
it all came back to him with a rush&mdash;the campaign,
the election, the defeat. He rose and drew his
watch from his waistcoat, lying on the floor. It
was too dark to see its face. He switched on the
electricity&mdash;the watch had stopped. Then he went
to the window and looked down into the street.
The lights were blazing, and thereby, and by the
throngs hurrying along and by the crowded cars,
<span class="pagenum2 hide" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>he knew that it must be evening. How long he
had slept he did not know. He could not remember
how or when he had got to bed. His sleep had
hardly refreshed him. It had been too deep, too
heavy; he was feverish and his muscles were sore.
But he dressed and went downstairs. Somehow,
instinctively, without giving himself any reason he
stopped at the headquarters of the state committee,
but the rooms were dark, deserted. The dead odor
of stale tobacco smoke hung heavy in the air.</p>

<p>At the desk in the rotunda below, the clerk gave
him his mail, with some pleasantry about the great
victory. Garwood stared at him blankly, with
the dumb ache at his heart, with some resentment
too, that the clerk should not have known what a
dash of bitterness that cup of victory held for him.
Mechanically he began to thumb his letters over as
he stood there, and presently laid them aside that
he might open several telegrams he found
among them, with that sense of precedence which
telegrams always take over every other missive.
With the first one his eyes widened in astonishment,
and then suddenly he was aware that Warfield
was shaking his hand and saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old man, congratulations. It&rsquo;s all the
sweeter now, isn&rsquo;t it? Why! You look surprised,
what&rsquo;s the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood looked up at Warfield and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew till just this minute, when I read
Rankin&rsquo;s telegram. I just got up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d pull through all the time,&rdquo; said
Warfield, with as much truth as retroactive prophecy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>can ever hold. &ldquo;I thought last night they were
holding out down there, and that when the whole
vote got in, you&rsquo;d be found to have won out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood&rsquo;s soreness had gone, and he took a long
breath as if to draw into his very being this glad
new sense of victory. In an instant a new glory
had been added to life. He took Warfield by the
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get the evening papers,
and then go and have a little drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They strolled toward the news stand, and Garwood&rsquo;s
eye ran down the pages as he waited for his
change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I carried Bromley&rsquo;s home county! I
thought I&rsquo;d lose that anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the story helped out over there,&rdquo; said Warfield.
&ldquo;Bromley got the Sunday-school vote, and
that drove the rest to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! Wasn&rsquo;t it a landslide though!&rdquo; said Garwood.
&ldquo;Keep the change,&rdquo; he called to the young
man behind the news stand. &ldquo;Well, I was glad the
party won even when I thought I had lost,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; Garwood was reading, as
he walked, the paper he had opened wide. &ldquo;Logan
County gives me a majority of eighteen hundred;
what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were at the bar by this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will it be?&rdquo; said Garwood, still devouring
his papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a little bourbon,&rdquo; said Warfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Garwood, crumpling the papers
under his arm. &ldquo;I want to drink Jim Rankin&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>health, bless his old heart! He gets the post-office,
he does! Give us a bottle of champagne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had your dinner yet, have you?&rdquo;
Warfield asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nor my breakfast, either,&rdquo; laughed Garwood.
But then Garwood was not as well informed
as Warfield as to the relation in time of liquors to
dinner. Warfield had been longer in politics.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HREE weeks after election there fell a night
when carriage lamps twinkled among the
black tree-trunks in the yard of the Harkness
home. The drivers of these vehicles in liveried
coats of varied shades that had faded through all
the tones of green and blue and brown and violet,
with top hats that marked every style for two
decades, lounged on their high seats flinging each
other coarse jokes, and cracking their whips softly
at the few brown leaves that clung so tenaciously
to the oaken boughs above them.</p>

<p>Within the house, there was the white desolation
of canvas-covered carpets, and the furniture had
been pushed back against the wall in anticipation of
a later crush of people whose bodies would supply
a heat now sadly lacking in the rooms. Ethan
Harkness sat in his library, uncomfortable in his
evening clothes, eying dubiously and with occasional
dark uprisings of rebellion, the white gloves
his daughter had decreed that he should wear. The
caterer, from Chicago, had driven him to bay,
and now chased his shining black men through
the old man&rsquo;s apartments as though he owned them.
In the dining-room and hall, little tables were being
laid, and little camp-chairs unfolded, for the destructive
supper of salads and ices, which, having
displaced the more substantial evening meal of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>establishment, would not now be served until a late
hour, when its inadequacy would be more noticeable.
In the front hall, an orchestra had assembled.
Now and then the strings of the instruments would
twang in tuning. On all the chill atmosphere hung
the funereal odor of cut flowers.</p>

<p>Upstairs, in her own room, Emily stood before
a long pier glass arrayed finally in the white bridal
gown on which the feminine interest of that house
and town had centered for many days. Before her
a dressmaker, enacting for this evening the rle of
maid, squatted on her heels, her mouth full of pins;
behind her, another dressmaker enacting a similar
rle was carefully, almost reverently, unfolding the
long tulle veil; about her were clustered the bridesmaids,
all robed in their new gowns. They had
been chattering and laughing, but now, in the supreme
moment, a silence had fallen&mdash;they stood
with clasped hands and held their breath. In the
center of the room, Dade Emerson stood in her
superior office of maid of honor, her head sidewise
inclined, her eyes half closed that through the haze
of their long black lashes she might estimate with
more artistic vision the whole bridal effect. Presently
she nodded to the dressmaker, and the patient
woman, her own pinched bosom under its black
alpaca bodice thrilling strangely with the emotions
of a moment that had been denied her, lifted the
veil on her extended fingers, and proceeded to the
coronation. She piled the white cloud upon the
brown coils of Emily&rsquo;s hair; she deftly coaxed it
into a shimmering cataract down the silken train
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>of the gown, and then took a step backward, while
all the women there raised their clasped hands to
their chins in an ecstatic, unisonant sigh.</p>

<p>Emily turned her eyes, brilliant with the excitement
of this night, toward Dade, who still stood
with her head critically poised. Dade nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est bien</i>,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The spell was broken, the chattering began again,
and the girls swarmed about for gloves and bouquets,
at last seating themselves impatiently to let
the maids fasten their furred opera boots.</p>

<p>Emily still stood before the long pier glass, looking
at her bridal reflection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all fixed?&rdquo; said Dade, &ldquo;with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Something old and something new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something borrowed and something blue?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The bridesmaids looked up with lips apart, awaiting
the answer to this all-important question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My handkerchief is old,&rdquo; said Emily, holding in
her fingers a bit of point lace that had been her
mother&rsquo;s, &ldquo;and&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m pretty much all
new to-night.&rdquo; She glanced down at her gown.
&ldquo;Something borrowed&mdash;I have nothing borrowed.&rdquo;
She looked up soberly, her eyes wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something blue?&rdquo; one of the girls asked, though
the first question had not been disposed of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;d bean me, running all that blue
baby-ribbon in her chemise, you&rsquo;d think so,&rdquo; said
Dade.</p>

<p>The bride blushed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But something borrowed,&rdquo; one of the others
insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, something borrowed,&rdquo; assented Emily.
&ldquo;What can I borrow, I wonder?&rdquo; She looked
about helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh say, girls!&rdquo; one of the bridesmaids exclaimed,
&ldquo;she must have a coin in her slipper!&rdquo;
And the whole bevy chorused its happy acquiescence.
Emily, with the sudden air of a queen,
unaccustomed to waiting on herself, commanded
Dade:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look in that box on my dressing-table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dade picked her way through the disorder of the
room to the little dressing-table, with its candles
lighted, adding their heat to the room. She looked,
and found nothing. Then she flew from the room,
crossed the hall, and returning, gave Emily a silver
dime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend it to you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be something
borrowed, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all arranged. The bride glanced again
in her mirror, turned about, inspected her train,
preened herself like some white bird, ready for final
flight. The old maid scanned the bride&rsquo;s face critically.
It was radiant, but&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m red as a beet!&rdquo; Emily pouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot as pepper in here anyway,&rdquo; one of the
bridesmaids panted.</p>

<p>The old maid took a powder puff and touched
the bride&rsquo;s face, touched the cheeks, and at last the
forehead, where tiny drops of perspiration sparkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; she said, with her last dab.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>
<p>Emily turned to her with a final glance of questioning.
The old dressmaker&rsquo;s eye lighted at the
sight of the young girl in her bridal dress. She
took a step toward her, her thin, withered lips
trembling. &ldquo;May I&mdash;kiss you?&rdquo; she asked, timidly.</p>

<p>And then, carefully, reverently, as she had
crowned her with the veil, she approached, and
kissed her. The eyes of the bridesmaids, in the
emotion that weddings excite in girls, became
moist with tears.</p>

<p>There were, of course, further feminine delays,
but at last, gathering their rustling skirts about
their ankles, the bride and her retinue made a
dazzling white procession down the staircase.</p>

<p>Her father awaited her. The caterer and his
black men, the cook and old Jasper, the men of the
orchestra, all had gathered in the parlor to see her.
Emily paused at the foot of the stairs, blocking the
procession that was but half descended. She
looked at her father with smiling eyes. The old
man glanced at her a moment, and then solemnly
drew near. When he had taken her fresh and
radiant face between the hands that were still ungloved,
he kissed her, and then turned suddenly and
went back to his library scrubbing his face with
his handkerchief. So the sadness that weddings
inspire, possibly because the estate of matrimony is
entered into by all lightly and with merry confidence
in a future that shall be miraculously exempt
from the griefs and woes of life, fell upon the little
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile all the closed carriages the livery-stables
of Grand Prairie could muster were rolling
along Sangamon Avenue, stretching frostily white
under a November moon. Their rendezvous was
St. James Church, over the stony tower of which
some native ivy had kindly grown to give the
English effect so much desired. An awning was
stretched from the curb to the Gothic doorway,
and about it were already gathered ragged
children and truant servant girls, willing to shiver
in the night air for a mere glimpse of the
bride, and perhaps of the groom, who, so short a
time before acclaimed as the popular champion of
equal rights, was now to be identified with that
fashionable exclusiveness which is separated by
satin ribbons and striped awnings from the mass
of mankind. Inside, the church lights were blazing;
at the door, two policemen, in new white cotton
gloves, stood guard.</p>

<p>Garwood, dressed for the first time in his life
in evening clothes, was restlessly pacing the musty
sacristy of the church. With him were Dr. Abercrombie,
the rector of the parish, in his white surplice
and stole, and Colonel Warfield, his best man.
Garwood had found difficulty in selecting a man
for this affair. When, in discussing the plans for
the wedding, he had learned from Emily that it
devolved upon him to choose not only a best man
but groomsmen and ushers, he had found, in casting
over his acquaintances, that he had none who
were intimate enough and at the same time fashionable
enough to fill these social offices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>But he had thought of Colonel Warfield, and as
he considered how peculiarly fitting it was that a
man of Colonel Warfield&rsquo;s social and political position
in the state should attend him at a wedding
which would attract the attention his was sure to
attract, he assumed an intimacy that did not exist,
and boldly invited the colonel to serve him in this
delicate capacity. He could not, for public reasons,
have made a better selection. The old bachelor,
with as many social as political campaigns to his
credit, was too polite to decline, and so came down
to Grand Prairie, giving, by his position, a new importance
to Garwood in the eyes of the politicians
of Illinois, and by his white hair and military bearing,
a distinction to the wedding that made it complete.</p>

<p>As they paced the floor of the sacristy on this evening,
awaiting the signal of the bridal party&rsquo;s
coming, the colonel chatted at his ease with the
rector, while Garwood paused now and then to
look through the peep hole that long ago had been
whittled in the panel of the door that opened into
the church. He could see, as in a haze, the flowers
and faces and fluttering fans of society. He could
detect, here and there, one of the numerous politicians
he had invited in order to make his list of
guests equal to the one Emily had written out. Far
down at the front he could see Jim Rankin, scorning
evening dress, with his little wife beside him in
a hat she had retrimmed that very evening, and
finally, within the space marked by the bows of
white ribbon for the family, he saw his mother, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>the new black silk gown he had bought for her
when he found his credit immeasurably strengthened
by his success in politics and love. She was
fanning herself complacently, yet through big
spectacles that fortunately lent benignity to an
otherwise disapproving gaze, looking with an eye
he knew was hostile at the trappings of this high
church. And yet her face was not without its trace
of pride that she was the mother of a son who could
lead out of this stronghold of fashion and exclusiveness
one of its reigning peeresses.</p>

<p>The organist had been improvising, while the
people gathered. Now that they were all there
and a hush disturbed only by the rustle of fans
had fallen upon the sanctuary, his improvisations
were subjected to a keener criticism, and his inspiration
failed him, so that his work lagged and
degenerated into minor chords. The hour for the
wedding had passed, and those who had been reviving
the gossip that Emily had made Garwood&rsquo;s
election a condition precedent to her marrying him,
began to discuss with keen excitement the possibility
of his or her failing at the last minute.</p>

<p>The gossip had entered grooves that led to certain
passages in Garwood&rsquo;s early life, when some
electrical contrivance buzzed. The music ceased, a
hush fell within the church. The priest and Colonel
Warfield straightened up and took their places
as if for a procession. Garwood saw the ushers,
chosen by Emily from the number of young men
who once had so ineffectually called upon her, pace
slowly down the aisles, unrolling white satin ribbons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>along the backs of the pews. Then the rector
entered the church, and Garwood found himself
with Colonel Warfield by his side, standing before
that flowered and fanning multitude.</p>

<p>The organ had begun the strains of the bridal
chorus from Lohengrin, women were twisting
their heads, and far down the aisle he saw Dade
with her huge bouquet of chrysanthemums moving
with stately, measured tread toward the altar. And
behind her, he saw Mr. Harkness, looking older
than he had ever known him, and on his arm, her
eyes downcast behind her veil, was Emily, kicking
her silken white bridal gown with her little satin-slippered
toes. When she saw him a light that
made his heart leap came into her eyes, and he became
suddenly, dramatically bold, so that he left
the colonel and strode forward to meet her. He led
her to the altar, and the priest began his solemn
words. Garwood stood there, conscious of the
beautiful woman beside him, her hand in his, conscious
of Warfield picking the ring with experienced
fingers from the palm of his gloved hand,
conscious of Dade near by holding Emily&rsquo;s bouquet,
conscious of the priest&rsquo;s flowing surplice before
him, of the flowers and palms around him, of
the crowd behind fanning the perfume of toilets
into the heated air.</p>

<p>Then he was kneeling stiffly upon a satin pillow,
the soles of his new shoes showing to the congregation,
the organ was softly playing, giving
a theatrical effect to the impressively modulated
words of the clergyman, and then they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>on their feet again; Dade had parted Emily&rsquo;s veil,
and he saw her looking up at him, her pale face
aglow, in her deep eyes a light that showed the
influence of sacerdotal rite. Then as it was borne
upon his soul that she was his, wholly his at last,
with the male&rsquo;s joy of absolute possession, he set
his lips upon hers and kissed her before them all.</p>

<p>The organ swelled into the wedding march that
has become a tradition, and he was striding down
the aisle with Emily on his arm. He saw his
mother&rsquo;s tears, he saw Rankin, the big fellow furtively
knuckling his eyes, and then winking drolly
at him, he saw Mr. Harkness, who, he suddenly
remembered, was now his father-in-law, pale and
stern. And so they left the church and passed out
under the canopy to the waiting carriage.</p>

<p>Garwood, like a king come from his crowning,
felt a kindness for all the world, even for the poor
folk gathered on the sidewalk striving for a glimpse
of the bride&rsquo;s gown. He felt his heart leap toward
them, so that like a king, he longed to fling a
golden largess to them.</p>

<p>The carriage door slammed. Josh Bowers, from
the livery-stable that had provided the carriages,
shouted some big order to the driver, and they
whirled away. Once more he saw the gleam in
Emily&rsquo;s eyes, liquid in the cold light that found its
way from the moonlit night into the carriage,
and, regardless of her dress, though he thought of
it, he crushed her in his arms, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last&mdash;my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE old court house in Grand Prairie, its
mighty blocks of sandstone evenly browned
by the justice and equity of the rain and
wind, lifted its Doric columns in the sunshine of a
June morning. Under the cornice of its pediment
the sparrows were scuffling, and in the elms that
grew about, clipping their boughs in a stately way
to the breeze, blue jays were chattering, while the
tame squirrels, the legal pets of the county supervisors,
gamboled impudently on the grass and on
the graveled walks. Around the four sides of
the square the raw brick buildings stood baking
in the sun, and at the long hitching racks,
gnawed during years of cribbing, horses were
stamping and switching at the flies. On any
other Monday morning the racks would have
been empty, but this day the court house&rsquo;s
weather-beaten floors, fluttering with old notices of
sheriff&rsquo;s sales, were swung wide, and through them
sauntered lawyers and jurymen and those who
could quit the pleasant benches in the yard outside
for the mild excitement of the June term of the
Circuit Court that day to be begun and holden.</p>

<p>As Jerome B. Garwood, walking with the easy
and dignified tread that befits a congressman, came
down Sangamon Avenue and saw once more the
familiar square, he experienced a revulsion of sentiment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>a sense almost of despair, to think that he
was back again in the sleepy little prairie town.
All the way from Washington he had looked forward
to being at home again. He had thought how
good it would be to see Emily once more, and the
little six months old baby whose inspired messages
of love had filled all her letters to him; he had
thought he would enjoy the quiet of his old law
office, and the shade and repose of the town, which,
as visitors in Grand Prairie were told when they
happened down in the winter or spring or fall or
late summer, was always at its best in June. Something
of this anticipation had been realized Saturday
night when he had reached home and hugged
the boy in his arms again, but the quiet of one
Sunday, and, more especially, the dolor of one
old-fashioned Sunday evening had dispelled all his
pleasure, and this morning, when he turned into the
ugly square, the whole of what life in Grand
Prairie really was, seemed to rise before him and
roll over him in a great wave of discontent.</p>

<p>He thought of the long, wide sweep of Pennsylvania
Avenue, with the mighty dome of the
Capitol at the end, he recalled the excitement and
distinction of a morning session of the House when
the members were all coming in, he could
still feel in his ears the roar and tumult
of the closing scenes of the long session, and he
gave way to that childish method of self-torture in
which he would continually remind himself of
what he had been doing two weeks ago that
day, or a week ago that day, or even at that hour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>four days ago. Before he could return to
that life, a long hot summer in Grand Prairie
was to be endured, but more than that, the
agony of a campaign in the fall. The fear and
apprehension this caused him, were heightened by
the state of affairs in the district; for the first thing
he had learned on reaching home was that his
fences were in bad shape, and Jim Rankin, when
Garwood had escaped the baby&rsquo;s fretful cries and
gone forth to find his old manager, had confirmed
the sad news. And as if this were not enough in
itself, Rankin had allowed himself to be beaten for
chairman of the county committee, and had lost
control of the local organization! The county convention
had been held, and a delegation to the congressional
convention selected which not only was
not instructed for him, but was probably hostile.
He cursed Rankin for that. The thought of defeat
was insupportable to him&mdash;to leave Washington
now and come back to Grand Prairie to stay! The
idea revolted him. He found some comfort in
remembering that he still had the short session
before him, though that would not begin until
December, six months off. If worst came to worst,
he might induce the president to take care of him
in some appointive office. And then he laughed at
himself and took a long, deep breath of the pure
ozone from his native prairies, contaminated somewhat
to be sure in passing over the dirty square,
but still active enough to fill him with determination
to win in the coming convention, and to be relected.
He allowed himself one more sigh in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>thinking how pleasant to be a congressman if it
were not for the agony of the swiftly recurring
biennial election, and then straightened up, strode
across the square, and took the old familiar walk
to the court house door.</p>

<p>He was really a fine looking man, was Garwood,
as he threw his shoulders back, and gave his head
that old determined toss, finer looking then as a
congressman than he had been as a mere candidate
for Congress a year and a half before. Perhaps
it was because he had grown stouter, perhaps it
was the finer manner of a man of the world he had
learned in Washington, perhaps it was his well-groomed
appearance, for his long black coat had a
gloss of richness rather than the shine of poverty,
his trousers were creased and fitted neatly over his
low shoes, his white waistcoat curved gracefully
over the paunch of prosperousness, his shirt, as a
student of clothes might have noticed, was made
with the collar and cuffs attached&mdash;the easy way
to be marked for a gentleman&mdash;while the wide
Panama hat he wore had the distinguishing effect
of having been bought somewhere else. But more
than all, it was the atmosphere of official position
which enveloped him&mdash;and of which he was thoroughly
conscious&mdash;that spread a spell over the observer.
No one would ever call him Jerry now, or
ever again, unless, perhaps, in the heat of his campaign
for relection. Of his face, it may be said
that it was fuller and redder; the mouth, clean
shaven, had taken on new lines, but they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>hardly as pleasing as the old ones had been in the
days before.</p>

<p>And so he made his dignified progress up to the
court house. He had intended, on coming down,
to go to his office where young Enright, lately admitted,
was holding forth with a bright new sign
under Garwood&rsquo;s old one, but it occurred to him
that it would benefit him to reassert his relation to
the bar of Polk County by appearing in court on
term day, and sitting or standing about. Perhaps
Judge Bickerstaff would invite him to sit beside
him on the bench. He remembered that that was
what the judge used to do whenever General Bancroft
came home from Washington.</p>

<p>He had been bowing to acquaintances all the way
down town with his old amiable smile, seeking
to disarm it of a new quality of reservation that
had lately entered into it, but now, in the cool dark
tunnels they called corridors, he met men face to
face, and all the way along, and even up the steep
and winding stairs that curved after a colonial pattern
to the upper story, he must pause to take their
hands, and carefully, and distinctly, according to
the training he had given his memory in this
respect, call them by name; more often than not
by their given names. When he left them, they
felt a glow of pleasure, though they were all the
while conscious that something was lacking in this
apparent heartiness.</p>

<p>The court room itself was full. In the benches
outside the bar sat the jurymen and the loafers
who hoped to be jurymen, or, at least, talesmen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>Within the bar, the lawyers were tilting back their
chairs, chewing their cigars, keeping near the huge
brown spittoons. On the bench, the judge, his
spectacles on, sat with the docket open before him.
The bailiff, whom Garwood in imitation of the
courtly way old General Bancroft had brought with
him from Virginia, by way of Shawneetown, always
longed to address as &ldquo;Mr. Tipstaff,&rdquo; but never
dared do so, was just finishing crying his third
&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; as he pronounced the proclamatory
&ldquo;Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!&rdquo; The lawyers noticed Garwood,
and as the calling of the docket proceeded,
got up to shake his hand, and to ask him about
Washington and the great affairs of state, all of
them displaying that professional relation to politics
which lawyers cultivate and affect. Though most
of them, be it said, seemed to confuse the good of
their party with the good of the country. Those
who belonged to the party then out of power, were
treated as if they were aliens, with no possible
right to an interest in what the people&rsquo;s servants
were then doing at the nation&rsquo;s capital.</p>

<p>Garwood was surprised, but vastly pleased, when
the judge called the title of a cause which in Garwood&rsquo;s
ears had a familiar sound. And as he
was adjusting this haunting recollection, the judge,
looking over his glasses and keeping a forefinger
on the docket, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you represent the plaintiff in that case,
Mr. Garwood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood arose, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to ask your Honor to pass that case
temporarily, if the Court please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will go to the heel of the docket then,&rdquo; said
the court.</p>

<p>After that Garwood went up to the bench, and,
stooping respectfully as he passed between it and
the lawyers in front of it, he went around and shook
the judge&rsquo;s hand. And then after they had whispered
about each other&rsquo;s health a moment, the
judge invited Garwood to sit beside him, which he
did. He sat there while the docket was called,
imagining how it would feel to be a judge, in order
to compare the feeling with the feeling one has
as a congressman. He half wished he were a
judge instead of a congressman. He was certain
he would rather be a federal judge than a congressman&mdash;that
place was for life, with no elections to
harass the incumbent. He began to speculate on
the length of time the district judge for the Southern
District of Illinois would probably live. He
might get that place if he were relected and the
judge should die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is Judge Pickney&rsquo;s health now?&rdquo; he asked
of Judge Bickerstaff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not well, I hear,&rdquo; whispered the court, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
going away for the summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only successful men could get that place&mdash;he
must by all means be relected. As he sat there,
idly speculating, all the happiness he had hoped to
find as congressman clouded by the constant dread
of defeat, he suddenly saw, at the rear of the court
room, the red face of Jim Rankin. When Rankin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>caught the congressman&rsquo;s eye, he motioned with his
curly head. Garwood thanked the judge, excused
himself, came down from the bench, carefully
bowed to those members of the bar he could catch
in the sweep of his eye, and went out to join
Rankin.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ANKIN was plainly glad to see Garwood, and
as they walked along looked at him with a
sidelong glance of pride, as with some
artistic sense of pleasure in his handiwork.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to have you back again,&rdquo; said the big
Rankin, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go into Chris&rsquo;s an&rsquo; have a little drink
just for the sake of the good old times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood, who found the new times so much
better than the old times, had not yielded much to
the warmth of Rankin&rsquo;s good humor. He was
displeased and sore. Rankin felt this, but he had
been used to his moods of old, and he loved Garwood
with such a frank, lasting affection, and his
own heart was so whole, that he refused to think
it anything but a mood that would pass. Garwood,
though, consented to drink readily enough. Indeed
he had been feeling ever since he came down that
a drink would put him in better sorts. They went
into Chris&rsquo;s place, and found it cool and pleasant
after the hot sidewalk outside, though Garwood,
mentally comparing it with Chamberlain&rsquo;s, felt
again his twinge of homesickness for Washington.
The bar at Chamberlain&rsquo;s, he remembered, did not
smell of stale beer as this one did. Steisfloss himself
was behind the long counter, and wiped his
hands on his white apron before extending one of
them to Garwood in welcome home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it going to be, gentleman?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a beer,&rdquo; said Rankin readily, mopping
his hot brow with his big palm.</p>

<p>Garwood hesitated, as though to give the question
some thought. Steisfloss and Rankin both
looked at him while he was reaching his decision.
At last he said, as thought he were conferring a
favor:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you may make me a manhattan cocktail,
Chris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steisfloss paused, but only for an instant, and
then he said promptly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Garwood, but I&rsquo;m out o&rsquo; manhattan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood glanced at him and smiled faintly.
Steisfloss detected the smile, and Garwood instantly
feared he had lost, not only a vote, but the influence
of a saloon. Rankin sprang to the rescue of both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, take a beer,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Garwood. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been very well
lately&mdash;I reckon you can give me some bourbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Washington living&rsquo;s too high fer you, eh?&rdquo;
said Rankin genially. But he saw that Garwood
again was displeased and so hastened to mollify
him, by adding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh well, you&rsquo;ll be all right. It&rsquo;s this hot weather.
You&rsquo;ll be all right when you&rsquo;re rested out. You
ought to go away somewhere and take a vacation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Garwood, quickly assenting to the
proposition, &ldquo;Senator Ames wanted me to go with
him to Rye Beach later on&mdash;reckon I&rsquo;ll have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They drank and left. They found Garwood&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>old offices deserted, for Enright had dutifully gone
over to the court house in order to be seen among
the other lawyers who really had business there,
little enough though it was. And when they had
tossed up the windows to let some air into the
musty rooms, and Rankin had leaned dangerously
out on the dusty window-ledge to lower the ragged
awnings, they seated themselves as of old, in the
worn chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; Garwood said, in tones that were
almost a command, &ldquo;tell me about it. How in hell
did it ever happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin shifted uneasily. He grew a shade redder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, Jer&mdash;&rdquo; he was about
to say &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; but he found it hard now to call
his congressman &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; so he avoided names; &ldquo;to
tell you the truth,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I never dreamed it
of &rsquo;em. I never dreamed &rsquo;at there was an&rsquo;thin&rsquo; in
the talk ag&rsquo;inst you. I couldn&rsquo;t believe &rsquo;at any one
could have it in fer you!&rdquo; He looked up at Garwood
with a trust and affection that were moving,
though they did not move Garwood, who sat with
his face averted, looking out of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, you see,&rdquo; Rankin went on, &ldquo;there was that
row out at Ball&rsquo;s Corners, ol&rsquo; man Barker was sore
&rsquo;bout the post-office&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never promised it to him!&rdquo; Garwood interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he thought you did, leastways he said
you did; an&rsquo; then there was some farmers out in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>Briggs to&rsquo;nship who claimed the seed you sent &rsquo;em
wouldn&rsquo;t grow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood looked at Rankin in stupefaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; then,&rdquo; Rankin went on, &ldquo;they said you
didn&rsquo;t answer the&rsquo;r letters &rsquo;bout it when they wrote
an&rsquo; told you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Crawford did, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Garwood said.
Crawford was his private secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Rankin, &ldquo;but they said you
didn&rsquo;t answer the&rsquo;r letters personally. Does Crawford
sign your name, or stamp it onto the letters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The damn fools!&rdquo; Garwood could only exclaim,
helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know ol&rsquo; General Bancroft&rsquo;s strong
holt al&rsquo;ays was &rsquo;at he answered his constits&rsquo; letters
right away, an&rsquo; in his own hand write. An&rsquo;&mdash;oh,
ther&rsquo; &rsquo;as a lot o&rsquo; little things like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there any feeling over my vote on the
armor-plate bill?&rdquo; asked the congressman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, some, that is, some talk about your sidin&rsquo;
in &rsquo;ith the corporations, but not a great deal, mostly
just such little feelin&rsquo;s as a man al&rsquo;ays encounters
after he&rsquo;s been in office a little while. I didn&rsquo;t
think it &rsquo;uld amount to much, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it did,&rdquo; said Garwood, setting his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it did,&rdquo; acquiesced Rankin. &ldquo;But Pusey
was at the bottom of it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pusey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Pusey. The truth is I underrated Pusey&rsquo;s
stren&rsquo;th&mdash;that&rsquo;s the whole of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were silent a minute, and then Garwood
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Rankin went on, &ldquo;you see Pusey&rsquo;s been
comin&rsquo; up in the world this last year. After he got
holt o&rsquo; the <i>Citizen</i>, which no one thought he ever
could do, he braced up consider&rsquo;ble an&rsquo; started in
fer to edit a clean sheet&mdash;a reg&rsquo;lar home an&rsquo; fireside
companion. You wouldn&rsquo;t know &rsquo;im now&mdash;new
clothes, plug hat Sundays, an&rsquo; he gets shaved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shaved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep, has a cup at the barber&rsquo;s with a quill pen
painted onto it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They marveled sufficiently, and Rankin resumed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s al&rsquo;ays had it in fer me you know, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
a pretty slick one, he is, if I must say so. He went
to work quiet like, to beat me out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he did it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, he done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin sunk his hands in his trousers&rsquo; pockets
and slid his heels across the floor until his legs
were stretched out before him. Then he stared
abstractedly, thinking of his defeat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get through with it. I read in the
papers &rsquo;at Congress &rsquo;uld adjourn the last o&rsquo; May.
I thought we&rsquo;d ought to have an early convention.
I wanted to fix it all up and have an instructed
delegation waitin&rsquo; fer you on your return, so I
calls a meetin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the county committee, settin&rsquo; it on
Saturday the twenty-seventh. I felt pretty good
over it, too, for I thought I&rsquo;d took Pusey by surprise.
He didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; in the paper, but he
ain&rsquo;t the feller to be caught nappin&rsquo;&mdash;no sir, he
ain&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t give him credit fer it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did he do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do? Why, he didn&rsquo;t do a thing but&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll
tell it to you in its order. Everything seemed all
right. We met at the Cassell House. There wasn&rsquo;t
many there at first, not enough to make a quorum.
Then in walks old Sol Badger, an&rsquo; with him Lige
Coons from Ball to&rsquo;nship, an&rsquo; then who should follow
but Pusey himself! Well, I didn&rsquo;t think
nothin&rsquo; of it then, fer I s&rsquo;posed Pusey had come in
as a representative of the press, you know, and o&rsquo; course,
I didn&rsquo;t feel like sayin&rsquo; an&rsquo;thin&rsquo;. Some o&rsquo; our
fellers hadn&rsquo;t got in yit, but when Es Miller
arrived, up jumps Pusey an&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve
got a quorum now, let&rsquo;s get down to business.&rsquo; I
looks at him a minute inquirin&rsquo; like, an&rsquo; he smiles
back at me with that sof&rsquo; grin o&rsquo; his, like a cat, an&rsquo;
he says, &lsquo;I hold Mr. Golden&rsquo;s proxy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proxies!&rdquo; exclaimed Garwood, &ldquo;so that was it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, ev&rsquo;ry one o&rsquo; them fellers had proxies,
an&rsquo;&mdash;well, you can easy see how it come out. When
I see how it had been fixed, I changed my plans in
a minute, an&rsquo; wanted a late date fer the convention,
but they proposed an early one, fer the thirtieth.
An&rsquo; on the test vote they beat us by just one. Well,
Pusey had fixed it all up on the quiet. They sprung
their early convention, an&rsquo;, though they hadn&rsquo;t any
candidate, they beat the resolutions to instruct fer
you, an&rsquo; the delegation goes to the convention fer
to support who it wants to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom will it support?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sprague, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it looked like one of his tricks. Has
Moultrie held her convention?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they hold it next Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood was silent for a long time. He drew a
large cigar from his pocket and lighted it, rolling
out its thick, rich Havana smoke until it was half
consumed before he spoke again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve played hell, haven&rsquo;t you, Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin hung his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful sorry. I haven&rsquo;t slep&rsquo; a night thinkin&rsquo;
of it, but&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, Pusey done it, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pusey!&rdquo; sneered Garwood, putting all his contempt
for the man into his tone as he sniffed out
his name. &ldquo;Pusey! To think of Jim Rankin&rsquo;s letting
Free Pusey lick him that easy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve al&rsquo;ays underrated Pusey, I&rsquo;ve found
that out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve found it out&mdash;too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe. But he&rsquo;s slicker &rsquo;n I give him credit
fer bein&rsquo; an&rsquo; I take off my hat to him, damn his
dirty, lousy little soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men sat after that, staring out the window,
watching the lawyers coming out of the
court house across the wide street, Garwood deep
in gloom, wondering if he would have to resume
that life with the rest of them. They looked so
poor, their work so little and contemptible after
all he had grown accustomed to in Washington.
Rankin, however, could not long endure such a
melancholy attitude and he roused his big body
presently and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no use to get down in the mouth.
I&rsquo;ve won worse battles &rsquo;an this, an&rsquo; so&rsquo;ve you. An&rsquo;
we can win this. The delegation&rsquo;s uninstructed, an&rsquo;
I forced &rsquo;em to put some of our fellers on. It was
the hottest convention I ever see. Wisht you&rsquo;d
been here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Garwood bitterly, &ldquo;so do I&mdash;instead
I was staying on down in Washington
looking after their interests while the dear people
here at home were sharpening knives for me. How
did you get any of my fellows on the delegation?&rdquo;
he suddenly broke off to demand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. You see, I might &rsquo;ave had
the nomination fer county treas&rsquo;rer; they wanted
me to take it, fer they feared to make too big a
break in the party, but I made &rsquo;em let me name
half o&rsquo; the delegation instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, half&mdash;we split it up, though they got the
odd man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? You bet I&rsquo;m on, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be there, don&rsquo;t
you forget that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want the treasurership?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I might &rsquo;ave wanted it, some&mdash;it
&rsquo;uld be a good thing; come in mighty handy just
now.&rdquo; And Rankin expressively rattled the keys
in his empty pocket. &ldquo;But I thought it &rsquo;uld look
like treason to you, an&rsquo; it would; though it wasn&rsquo;t
no sacrifice, you havin&rsquo; promised me the post-office.
I knew I &rsquo;as sure o&rsquo; that. When does Bartlett&rsquo;s
term end?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In December,&rdquo; Garwood replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can hold out till then, if the neighbors
keeps on bringin&rsquo; things in. You couldn&rsquo;t hurry
it up, could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, hardly,&rdquo; said Garwood. &ldquo;But, tell me, what
does Pusey expect to get out of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does Pusey expect to get out of this?
Why, not a thing&mdash;but the post-office, himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Sprague promised it to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, fer enough votes from Polk to nominate
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph humph,&rdquo; said Garwood, slowly, through
his nose. &ldquo;Umph humph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s December the appointment&rsquo;s made,
we can fool him there, we can fool him there,&rdquo; said
Rankin, gleefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Garwood, though not heartily.</p>

<p>And then Rankin leaned over and laid a hand on
Garwood&rsquo;s knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t give up yet, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
can pull this game out o&rsquo; the fire; you can get that
nomination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood turned on him angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh yes!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Pretty figure I&rsquo;ll
cut going to a convention for renomination without
my own county behind me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we can fix that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How? I&rsquo;d like to know; how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Pusey&rsquo;s fellers is easy&mdash;you can get
enough o&rsquo; them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Garwood spoke in the hollow sternness
of despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the congressman threw back his head
and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy &rsquo;em, indeed!&rdquo; he laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Buy
&rsquo;em, indeed! Why, man, I haven&rsquo;t got through
paying my debts from the last campaign!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you get a sal&rsquo;ry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it costs to live in Washington&mdash;God,
how it costs! And with a family here at home in
the bargain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;there&rsquo;s the old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; said Garwood, rising in total loss of
patience, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of hearing this everlasting
twaddle about the old man! He&rsquo;s not rich, in the
first place, and now that he&rsquo;s out of the bank he&rsquo;s
poorer than ever. You people out here in the wilderness
think because a man was once president of
a little country bank, he&rsquo;s a millionaire. He hasn&rsquo;t
anything any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, how&rsquo;d he come to be beat fer pres&rsquo;dent
o&rsquo; the bank?&rdquo; said Rankin, ignoring Garwood&rsquo;s ill
humor in his zest to learn at last the inwardness of
a story about which Grand Prairie had been speculating
for six months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you some other time, Jim,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at his watch.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE year and a half that had gone since their
brilliant wedding had passed more slowly for
Emily than for Garwood. They had gone
East on a wedding journey, for Jerome had been
able, as the first perquisites of his new position, to
get passes, a trick he had already learned in the
Legislature, though there his &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; had
been confined to the limits of Illinois. They had
gone to New York and of course to Washington,
where their interests now centered. There they
made the conventional rounds, visiting the Capitol
and the White House, the Treasury and the Patent
Office, ascending the Washington Monument, going
over to Arlington and down to Mt. Vernon,
seeing all the sights. Emily thus gained a store of
memories that served her well in the months that
came after. She said she could the better imagine
Jerome going the daily rounds of his important
duties for having seen the places in which he would
be, and Garwood himself found that it was well to
have visited on his wedding trip all the points of
interest about the city, else he never would have
visited them at all. It mattered not, perhaps, that
Emily&rsquo;s imaginings of her husband&rsquo;s goings and
comings in Washington were far from the reality&mdash;they
served her as well as any.</p>

<p>She had planned during the long year in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>which Garwood waited so impatiently for the sitting
of Congress to go to Washington with him.
They had talked of it all the winter and during the
spring. When March came and with its fourth
day brought the sense that he was now in reality a
congressman, Garwood had felt an increase of importance
with an increase of impatience. The coming
of his first voucher soon after was a joy to
them both, and the four hundred and sixteen
dollars and sixty-six cents it called for seemed to
link them more firmly to officialdom. But Garwood
longed to be sitting in his seat in the House
of Representatives; to hear his name in the roll-call;
he felt that he would not realize it all until
he had been there long enough to have grown
familiar, and yet not so long as to begin to dread
the end. And Emily felt that her joy would not
be full until she had seen him there.</p>

<p>The whole time for her had held other duties,
duties of a sacred preparation, when she sat long
days in the sunlight, with her eyelids drooped over
white garments in her lap. Garwood had never
been so tender of her before, and he hung about
in a solicitude that betrayed a man&rsquo;s love and a
boy&rsquo;s awkwardness. With a woman&rsquo;s superior
intuition she was the dominant one in those days,
though the coming of the baby late in the fall left
her helpless, and restored him suddenly to self-confidence.
So, after all, when December came,
with its long anticipated first Monday, Emily could
not go to Washington with her husband and,
bruised by the wrench of their first parting, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>was left in the house with her father and her boy
to face a long winter alone. All that winter she
carefully read the accounts in the newspapers of
the proceedings of Congress, and cast her eye each
morning down the wide columns of the <i>Congressional
Record</i> seeking the magic name &ldquo;Mr. Garwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was only once or twice that she had the joy of
finding Jerome&rsquo;s name, and then what he said
seemed formal and distant, and did not have a personal
appeal to her. For instance, late in the session,
she read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Garwood addressed the Committee of the
Whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then in maddening parenthesis:</p>

<p>&ldquo;(His remarks will appear later.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when they did appear later, weeks later, on
the very first page of the <i>Record</i>, with the words,
&ldquo;Speech of the Honorable Jerome B. Garwood,&rdquo;
in black types at the head, they were long and full
of statistics, not at all like the fiery speech he had
made that last night of the campaign. She could
find no mention of the speech in the daily newspapers,
and she had her fears that Jerome was not
being appreciated. He had made an effort at first
to write to her daily, but soon there were lengthy
intervals between the letters, and the letters themselves
grew shorter, seeming to have been written
late at night, when he was tired and sleepy. But
they were always filled with admonitions for the
boy, and Emily found joy in translating them into
the baby tongue the child understood so well, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>she could tell by the big blue eyes and the cooings
of his drooling little lips.</p>

<p>In January, just as she was beginning to recover
her strength, a new trial came upon her, the last
she had ever anticipated. The directors of the bank
held their annual meeting, and to the surprise of
all Grand Prairie, her father was not relected
president. It was a blow to him, though he was too
proud to show it. Yet Emily could see the change
it wrought in him. He seemed to age suddenly,
and shrank from going out, spending most of his
time in his library, where he pretended to be reading
his books, though she often surprised him with
his glasses between the leaves in the old familiar
way, gazing out at nothing. He had made the fatal
discovery that old age was upon him at last.</p>

<p>Dade had gone away with her mother in search
of health at some new springs in Maine. After
trying their waters for a while they suddenly departed
for Europe, as Dade announced in an ecstatic
letter. Now they were in Holland, and Dade wrote
from Amsterdam of the quaintness of the place
and of the picturesque sails of the boats on the little
Amstel, comparing them for color to those one
sees, or imagines, on the Adriatic.</p>

<p>And so Emily was left alone with her old father
and infant child. She had looked forward ardently
to the adjournment of Congress and Jerome&rsquo;s return.
Now that he was come, she found that she
was to see little of him. He must plunge into the
campaign, he said.</p>

<p>On this Monday morning, he came in late for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>dinner, clapped his hands two or three times in the
baby&rsquo;s face, laughed at the winking of the blue
eyes, ate his dinner alone at a corner of the dining
table, smoked a cigar, read the Chicago papers,
threw them in a heap on the floor, and then
stretched himself on the divan in a dark corner of
the parlor and went to sleep.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>MILY put the child to bed and then went
down into the library to join her father, who
sat with his book in the mellow circle of the
reading lamp. She entered the room softly from
the habit that had grown upon her in the hours
when the baby might be wakened, and she sank
into a chair and folded her hands with a sigh. Her
father slowly glanced at her tired, thin face, but
did not move his head. He seemed to be reading
on, but presently he said, still without moving:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily lifted her head from the back of the chair
on which she had been resting it, fastened a lock
of her hair, smiled and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You let that young John E., or whatever his
name is, wear you out,&rdquo; her father insisted, taking
his glasses from his nose and marking his place
in his book after his old custom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; the mother said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not well.
I dread the summer so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems fretful,&rdquo; said the father, with a shade
of his original resentment lingering in his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not that, father,&rdquo; Emily replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
so active and full of energy. Mother Garwood says
Jerome was just so when he was a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been over there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I ran over to-day to ask her some things
about baby. She knows all about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you ought to have a nurse,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford it,&rdquo; the mother replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t afford it! He gets enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but it&rsquo;s so expensive living, as Jerome
must, at a hotel in Washington. And he&rsquo;s
in debt, with another campaign coming on. That&rsquo;ll
cost, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man raised himself in his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that with five thousand
a year, he might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The daughter also raised herself in her chair and
her dull eyes caught back some of their old brightness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, father, that Jerome does the best he
can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped; and so did he. They had sounded
that note several times of late. The truth was,
that the presence of Garwood in the house was already
beginning to have its effect on his father-in-law.
When Garwood was in Washington Harkness
felt a pride in him, but after he had been at
home for awhile, his various characteristics one
after another got on the old man&rsquo;s nerves, until he
could scarcely treat him civilly. He detested Garwood&rsquo;s
lazy habits, his lying abed in the mornings,
his afternoon naps, though Harkness took naps
himself, and he distrusted his long absences at
night. More than all he inwardly raged at Garwood&rsquo;s
extravagance, though he dared not complain
of it, for Emily had been firm in her insistence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>that they pay for their board, knowing, as she
did, her father&rsquo;s punctiliousness in matters of
money, a disposition likely to be cultivated by those
who have money enough to gratify it. Harkness
would doubtless have preferred that the Garwoods
keep house, as Jerome was always threatening to
do, but he could not bear the thought of the loneliness
Emily&rsquo;s absence would add to his idleness.
Restrained therefore from complaining of Garwood,
his discontent expressed itself in complaints
of himself, and he shuffled about the house with a
martyr&rsquo;s patient suffering written in his face, lowering
himself carefully into his chair whenever he
sat down, with a prolonged, senile &ldquo;Ah-h-h-h&rdquo; that
heralded, as he meant it to do, the encroachments
of age.</p>

<p>And then the baby worried him. They had given
the boy his name, Ethan, but they prefixed it with
the other name of John, which had belonged to
Garwood&rsquo;s father. Garwood had mildly protested
against the name of Ethan because he didn&rsquo;t care
for biblical names, though Emily had insisted that
Ethan was not a biblical name. The argument had
been settled, at least to Garwood&rsquo;s satisfaction, for
he claimed to have found the name in the Old Testament,
but with a firmness for which Emily said the
name itself stood, she insisted that the mere mention
of it in Holy Writ did not constitute it a biblical
name. But though young John Ethan kept his
grandfather&rsquo;s name he never found a way to his
grandfather&rsquo;s graces, at least he had not done so
yet, and this only added another complication to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>the many in which Emily found her life enmeshed.</p>

<p>And so this evening Harkness took refuge in his
senility and his troubles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he ventured with a sigh that he knew
was pathetic, &ldquo;if I could only afford it I&rsquo;d take you
and the boy away for the summer, but I&rsquo;m poor
now and old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t leave Jerome just now, father, but
this talk about your being poor and old is absurd,
absurd&mdash;and I want you to quit it. Why don&rsquo;t you
go away this summer? Go back to New Hampshire
for a rest. It would do you a world of good,
and you&rsquo;ve always said you were going as soon as
you could get away from the bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She checked herself, perceiving that she had hit
on an unfortunate subject, but her father replied
with a return of his old dry humor:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the bank was the principal obstacle, and
that&rsquo;s been removed now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He set his lips bitterly, and picked up his book
again. There was silence in the library, and Emily
rested. Now and then her father glanced at her,
but she did not move. She lay back in her chair,
relaxed in every fiber. He stood her inaction as
long as any man could, and then demanded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do something? Ain&rsquo;t you going
to read?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did rouse herself, obedient to his whims, but
she made an excuse:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go up and see how the baby&rsquo;s getting
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming down again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No; leave the door open for Jerome when you
come up, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he was left to the expectant silence that
oppresses a household when it awaits the coming
of one of its members before it can settle down for
the night. It was after midnight when Garwood
came. He threw the reeking end of his cigar into
the yard and toiled up the stairs breathing heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; Emily asked when he
entered their rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down town; where&rsquo;d you suppose?&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;News? What of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got a fight on my hands, that&rsquo;s the
news.&rdquo; He spoke as if she were responsible for
the fact, and she felt it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how interested the baby and I are,
Jerome. We&rsquo;ve been waiting here to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He softened at the mention of his child, and bent
over his cradle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waken him,&rdquo; the mother said, as he put
forth his big hand. And then she resumed her
questioning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Mr. Rankin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said hopefully, with the faith they
had always held in Rankin, &ldquo;he can bring it around
all right, can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He!&rdquo; said Garwood. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a back number!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>She drew the story out of him, and when she
had done so, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t forget, Jerome, that you once
said to me that we must be good to Jim Rankin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no reply for a long time, and she
followed him with eyes that looked large in her
thin face. After awhile, he paused in trying to
unbutton his collar, and turned his head around,
his chin thrust pointedly out over his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were out of debt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d quit the
whole business and open a law office in Chicago,
and let politics alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a common threat with him when he was
discouraged. And she had long since learned that
the threat to leave politics was common to all politicians,
just as the threat to leave the sea is common
to all sailors, or the threat to leave newspaper
work to all newspaper men. She felt herself the
fascination of the life, and so knew the insincerity
of the threat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you always say that when you&rsquo;re blue.
Don&rsquo;t worry any more to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Freeman H. Pusey of his second campaign
was after all the same Freeman H.
Pusey Garwood had known in his first campaign.
When Garwood entered the editorial room
of the <i>Citizen</i> that afternoon he expected, as the
result of Rankin&rsquo;s description, to see a regenerated
Pusey, but he found instead the same old character.
The little editor sat at a common kitchen table
worn brown and smooth by time and elbows and
piled with papers that showed deep deposits of dust
in their folds and wrinkles.</p>

<p>Those at the bottom of the pile were darkened
and seared by age, the strata of later eras
were in varying tones of yellow, while those atop,
the latest exchanges, were fresh and white, though
they showed great gaps where they had been mangled
by the long, shiny scissors that lay at the editor&rsquo;s
elbow. The scissors were the only thing about
the establishment that shone, unless it were the
cockroaches, which ran over everything, and
mounted the old paste pot, to scramble as nimbly
as sailors up the unkempt brush which held a dirty
handle aloft for instant use. The shining cockroaches
swarmed so thickly about the brush, pausing
now and then to wave their inquisitive antennae,
that Pusey, before he could prepare an editorial,
had to put them to rout, and he did this with his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>scissors, thrusting at the merry insects with the
point of them from time to time in a way that had
become habitual.</p>

<p>The desk had other articles of furniture, an old
cigar box half-full of tobacco, with an old corn-cob
pipe sticking in it&mdash;the only thing there that
the cockroaches avoided&mdash;and a copy hook, on
which Pusey had just hung the sheets of a
leaded editorial, to be set up as time-copy. Before
him lay a pile of copy paper, and with these
implements Freeman H. Pusey molded public
opinion in Polk County.</p>

<p>The room was dark, for the windows were thick
with dirt. From the room beyond came the slow,
measured clank and jar of the old bed-press, then
running off the afternoon edition, shaking the
building with each revolution of its cylinder. And
over all hung the smell of printer&rsquo;s ink, with its
eternal fascination for him who has ever breathed
it long.</p>

<p>The clothes that Pusey wore may or may not
have once been new. Garwood would have been
willing, out of court, and perhaps in court, had he
been retained on that side of the case, to identify
them as the ones Pusey had worn when last he saw
him. Just now, however, the coat was off and hanging
on the back of the chair with the same casual
impermanent effect that characterized the old straw
hat that sat back on Pusey&rsquo;s head showing the scant
hair that straggled over his dirty scalp. The editor
was in his shirt sleeves, the frayed wrist-bands of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>which were edged with black, and his feet for ease
were encased in old carpet slippers.</p>

<p>His face, and his mouth, with the small
mustache dyed black in that strange vanity which
did not extend to the rest of his person,
still had its moist appearance of olden times, and
he smoked his cigar, blowing the clouds of
smoke all about him. Having turned out as much
time-copy as the waning energies of his mind
could produce on such a hot afternoon he was now
clipping paragraphs out of the exchanges to add to
those which would keep the printers in work for
the remaining hours of the day their union had
decreed. He did his work with the leisurely air
that settles on editors in the first few minutes that
ensue after the paper has gone to press, pausing
now and then to stick at a cockroach with his scissors.
As Garwood entered, Pusey lifted his eyebrows,
and bending his gaze over the rims of his
spectacles tried to identify his caller through the
gloom of his sanctum. When he saw who it was,
he merely said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; and plunged the point of his scissors
into another exchange.</p>

<p>Garwood had been considering this visit for a
number of days. The disappointment of arriving
home to find that his county had failed to endorse
him, had been sinking more and more sorely into
his soul. It had seemed to him that a renomination
by acclamation was his by rights. Many of his colleagues
had already received such endorsements, or
vindications as they mostly called them, before they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>left Washington, and Garwood had helped them to
celebrate these triumphs in various bar-rooms.</p>

<p>He had been irritated by the fact that he could
not now spend his summer as befitted a congressman,
and obtain the rest a congressman certainly
requires after his onerous duties at Washington;
that is, by taking a dignified walk down town in
the morning, and a dignified nap in the afternoon.
In the evenings he had pictured himself
sitting on the veranda at home, as he now
considered the Harkness residence, with his legs
crossed and a cane between them, smoking
a cigar, and enlightening his wife and father-in-law,
while Grand Prairie rode by and said:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our congressman, he&rsquo;s home for the
summer.&rdquo; But instead he had come home to find
his own bailiwick invaded, his old friend Rankin
defeated, and his old enemy, Pusey, prospering beyond
all expectation, with a respectable newspaper
in which he printed articles slyly reflecting upon
Garwood, calling attention to the need of a new
post-office in Grand Prairie; to the beauties of uninstructed
delegations, whereby the people, for
whom, in his renaissance, Pusey was more than
ever solicitous, could at last achieve their rights;
to the fate that pursued arrogant bosses like Jim
Rankin, and so on.</p>

<p>But some of his old resolution had come back to
Garwood even in his enervation. He determined
to submit to defeat, if at all, only after a battle. He
was sorry he had scolded Jim Rankin so. After all,
though he was no longer chairman of the county
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>committee and had been beaten in the county convention,
Rankin was still chairman of the congressional
committee, and still his friend. Rankin had
only laughed at his reproaches, good natured as
ever. It would not do to break with Rankin. And
so, he had set out in the morning to see Rankin.
He had not found him at any of his usual haunts,
nor at the real estate and loan office where Rankin
made pretense of doing some sort of insurance
business, and going at last to Rankin&rsquo;s home he had
been told by Mrs. Rankin that Jim had gone out of
town, she did not know where. He would not be
back for two or three days. Garwood&rsquo;s intention
had been to call a conference of his closest friends
in Grand Prairie, and outline some plan of action,
though none had occurred to him as yet. But he
determined to defer this until Rankin&rsquo;s return.</p>

<p>The notion of calling on Pusey had been a sudden
inspiration, born of the necessity of doing
something at once, for his inaction was becoming
intolerable, especially with stories coming to him
constantly of Sprague&rsquo;s work in other counties.</p>

<p>He sat down at Pusey&rsquo;s bidding, and taking off
his Panama hat, began fanning himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hot, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Pusey, still clipping out his
little paragraphs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Garwood distantly. It was not the
heat of the weather that then distressed him. Pusey
kept his head turned away, so that Garwood had
only the side of his face, and its wizened profile did
not show the satisfaction that smiled in it. Pusey
was willing to keep all to himself the enjoyment of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>having Garwood humble himself by calling upon
him,&mdash;him, whom Garwood had once despised. Indeed,
the satisfaction he felt was so lively that he
was somewhat mollified in spirit and, had he known
it, Garwood could hardly have done a wiser or more
politic thing than to pay this visit to this same
Pusey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; said Garwood, &ldquo;though not so
hot as it was in Washington. That&rsquo;s the hottest
place in summer, you know, in the whole world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; said Pusey, stooping to paste
one of his little paragraphs on a sheet of copy paper.
He showed, however, no inclination to turn the
conversation from its perfunctory channel. Indeed,
the conventionality of it rather suited his mood and
gratified his pride, so that he was content to keep
Garwood under his embarrassment as long as possible.
But Garwood launched into his subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came over to see you, Mr. Pusey,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;and to have a little talk with you about&mdash;politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said Pusey, superciliously.</p>

<p>Garwood could have crushed him for his tone as
Pusey would have crushed the cockroaches he could
never hit, but he was better schooled to his part and
he thought of the agonies of defeat. He needed
every dollar of his salary now. So he went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are on the delegation, I believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I am; yes,&rdquo; Pusey replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Garwood, unable to resist the
impulse to assume his congressional manner, &ldquo;very
well. And I understand that you are opposed to
my renomination.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said so, have I?&rdquo; said Pusey, turning
his head for the first time and squinting at Garwood
over his spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reply took Pusey by surprise, and he lost
something of his position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you opposed me in the convention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not quite that,&rdquo; Pusey answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; and Garwood smiled his old consequential
smile once more and gathered his power to put
others ill at ease, &ldquo;it amounted to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you are a bit mistaken, Mr. Garwood,&rdquo;
Pusey replied. &ldquo;What I did was to oppose instructions.
I believed, you know, in sending a delegation
to the convention that shall be absolutely free
and untrammeled, so that it might be, as I may say,
instantly responsive to the will of the people. That
is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Garwood; &ldquo;I see. But let me
ask this&mdash;you <i>are</i> opposed to my nomination, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pusey was silent and did not answer for a long
time. He cut out another paragraph and cocked
his little head to one side, tilting the old straw hat
ridiculously as he trimmed the edges of the slip
with unusual and unnecessary care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said that,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, to get at it in another way&mdash;you will
pardon me, Mr. Pusey, for my persistent interrogation&mdash;let
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>me ask you this: You are in favor of
Mr. Sprague&rsquo;s nomination, are you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said that, either,&rdquo; Pusey promptly
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, if I understand your position, you are
free and untrammeled like the delegation. Is that
right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Pusey, laying down his scissors
and his papers, folding his hands in his lap, and
screwing about in his chair until for the first time
he squarely faced Garwood, at whom he looked
pertly, as little men can, through his spectacles,
&ldquo;exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He snapped out the word as if he relished it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Garwood, hitching his chair
closer as if instantly to seize his advantage, &ldquo;that
warrants me in asking you whether or not you can
give me your support?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pusey lowered his eyes and turned his face away.
He began plucking at the few withered hairs on his
chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; Garwood pressed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Pusey hemmed, &ldquo;I am hardly able to
determine so important a matter as that instantly,
Mr. Garwood. Complications might arise which
would not render it expedient for me to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood did not wait for Pusey to unwind one
of the long sentences he loved so well, but broke in:</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Pusey, let&rsquo;s be frank about this thing.
You and I may not have been friends in the past,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always treated you fairly since I ran a party
organ, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Pusey interpolated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think you have, Pusey, and I thank you
for it. I&rsquo;ve appreciated it. I was, in a way, glad
to see you get hold of the <i>Citizen</i>, for I knew you
could make a newspaper of it; you&rsquo;ve got the ability.&rdquo;
Pusey glowed, and Garwood continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve come to see you in your capacity of
delegate to a convention before which I am a candidate.
I don&rsquo;t want to take up any more of your
time than is necessary, but it has occurred to me
that if we had a little confidential chat, we might
understand each other better, that&rsquo;s all. I haven&rsquo;t
come to beg any favors, or any thing of that sort,
but merely to see where we stand, what we could
expect of each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you called, Mr. Garwood. I am
of course honored&rdquo;&mdash;the editor gave an absurd nod
of his head in Garwood&rsquo;s direction by way of a
bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I say,&rdquo; Garwood continued, warming, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
come to see you as a citizen and as a delegate, and
to ask you if you can conscientiously support me
for renomination. There is no other candidate
from this county, and it seems to me that as a matter
of local pride you might prefer a man from
your home to one from some other county.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Pusey answered, &ldquo;there is of course that
aspect of the case, Mr. Garwood. I do not say that
I will not support you, neither do I say I will. I
will say this, that if you are nominated I shall support
you for election earnestly and heartily; I may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>be permitted to add, perhaps, effectively. But for
the present I prefer not to commit myself. You
understand my position, both as a citizen and as an
editor. Of course conditions may arise under
which I would give you my vote and my support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask what those conditions are?&rdquo; Garwood
leaned over to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not say, mark me,&rdquo; Pusey replied in a corrective
tone, &ldquo;that the conditions exist now, but that
they may arise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you indicate them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would prefer, Mr. Garwood, to let events take
their own course and shape themselves. The convention
has not been called yet, and is some weeks
off; there will be ample time. I wish for the present
to feel that I am free to pursue the course that
seems wise to me&mdash;as a citizen and as an editor,
you understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Garwood, &ldquo;I am at least glad
to know that you are uncommitted; I am also glad
I called, and&rdquo;&mdash;he arose&mdash;&ldquo;I shall perhaps do myself
the honor to call again.&rdquo; He bowed and left,
and when he had gone, and the mockery was all
over, Pusey took the pipe from the tobacco box,
filled it, and lighted it from a gas jet he
kept burning for that very purpose. He smoked in
a way that evinced no enjoyment in tobacco whatever;
he smoked in a dry, habitual way, as he
talked, and ate, and wrote, but now he enjoyed his
reflections, for Garwood, who once had spurned
him, had called and humbled himself. Suddenly,
however, an idea struck him, and hastily leaning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>over and hooking his toes in their carpet slippers
behind the legs of his chair, he wrote feverishly
for an instant. When he had done he read the item
over, drew a line down through it, marked it
&ldquo;must,&rdquo; and hung it on his copy hook.</p>

<p>The item appeared the following evening in the
<i>Citizen</i>. It was this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hon. Jerome B. Garwood called upon us yesterday
afternoon. The congressman is looking extremely
well, despite his long and arduous duties
in the Capital, and the severe heat that marks the
recent season of the year at Washington. The congressman
is home for the summer. Call again,
Congressman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The evening following the <i>Advertiser</i>, the organ
of the opposition which, in Polk County at least,
had never been called into responsibility, copied
Pusey&rsquo;s personal item and made this comment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the congressman calls again he will be
wise to take the post-office with him, or something
equally as substantial as that which he is said to
have received over at Springfield in the long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-VI">VI</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was summer, the full flushed summer of central
Illinois and the corn stood tall on the
Sangamon bottoms, flashing its heavy blades
in the sun. Miles and miles it spread across Logan,
and Polk, and on into Moultrie County, where the
Kaskaskia flows widening down to join the
Mississippi at a place where the Sucker state
found the picturesque beginnings of its history.
There were long, calm days of scorching heat,
and other days, when the clouds closed over
the plains, and the humid air was too heavy
to breathe. But still the corn flourished,
rustling in the warm winds that blow forever
across the rolling prairies, and ripened fast against
the time when it should be hauled to the distilleries
along the placid Illinois or stored in long
cribs to await the ever-expected rise in the grain
market at Chicago. Viewed from some impossible
altitude, the great, green corn fields were broken
here and there by smaller fields of wheat, in which
some venturesome farmer reaped a little crop hardly
indigenous to that black soil, and to the eastward,
over the broad pastures of virgin prairie,
blocky cattle browsed and fattened at their leisure.
The mud roads lay deep in powdered dust, the
whole land droned in the full tide of warm summer
life, and men everywhere were glad, like the
<span class="pagenum2 hide" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>insects that made the throbbing air vocal with their
endless shrilling, like the cattle that huddled
through the long afternoons in the shade of some
wind-break of slender young trees, like the corn
itself forever glinting in the sun.</p>

<p>Of all the thousands of people, happy as the summer
in their toil, there was none who would have
ascribed his happiness to the government under
which he lived. Few of them, indeed, at that
busy season took any interest in their government.
Later on in the fall, when the summer was over and
the fields but bare ground, spiked with short-pointed
stalks, when the corn and the cattle had
been shipped to Chicago; in the days when the
darkness and the rain would come, they would
think of government, perhaps become excited about
it. But now, all over the Thirteenth Congressional
District, a few men in each county seat were gratuitously
attending to government for them, plotting
and scheming to place certain names on the ballot,
confident in the knowledge that in November the
people would divide themselves arbitrarily into parties,
and go through the empty formality of ratifying
the selections that would result from all their
man&oelig;uvers and machinations. Thus the business
of the people&rsquo;s government is carried on.</p>

<p>In Grand Prairie, Garwood, troubled and afraid,
knew that in each of the seven counties that comprised
his district there were little cliques of men
to whom this business of carrying on the people&rsquo;s
government was somehow, though no one could
tell just how, entrusted. If he could get enough of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>these men to think, or at least to say that he should
go back to Congress, they would choose certain of
their followers as delegates, and these would name
him. In all that great fertile land, in those seven
counties, out of two hundred thousand people it was
not even necessary that he secure the eighty-three
who would make a majority of the delegates to the
congressional convention; it was only necessary
that he secure half a dozen men, for these half
dozen would name the delegates who would express
the wishes of those two hundred thousand people.
And not only this, but this handful of men would
thus choose the other officers of all those two hundred
thousand individuals. They were men who
did not especially have at heart the interests of the
people, even of that portion of the people known
as the &ldquo;party&rdquo; they represented. They had only
their own interests at heart, and they conducted
the people&rsquo;s government for what they might themselves
get out of it in money and in power. Behind
them, it is true, were oftentimes men who were
either too respectable or too unpopular to engage
in politics; men who controlled large affairs, but
these also were interested in nothing but their own
business and the making of money. The happiness
of the people was not for them to consider; fortunately,
that was left to the winds; to the rolling
prairies; to the sight of the broad fields and the
cattle huddling at noon-time in the shade; to the
songs of birds, and insects, and children; to the sun
and the glint of the sunlight on the corn. When
the selection of candidates had been made, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>choice was between two men, Garwood knew that
there were enough of those two hundred thousand
ready to fight for the word by which his party was
called to place the name of its candidate on the
pay-roll of congressmen.</p>

<p>The few men who would thus tell the people
whom to choose were subject to influences. The
question was: what influence to employ in each particular
instance. There was but one other consideration;
these men were likely at times to lose their
occult power, and to be superseded by other men;
so that it was necessary to know just who was the
man in each county then in control. For instance,
in Polk County, Rankin had been this man, for
so long a time in fact that his power had extended
to other counties. But Rankin&rsquo;s power had been in
part destroyed; there were now two men in Polk
County to be considered&mdash;Rankin and Pusey. Unless
one could get both, it was necessary to make a
choice between them. But it was impossible to get
both, and it was a delicate matter selecting one or
the other.</p>

<p>Had Garwood been a man with a genius for details
and organization, or even possessed of an untiring
patience, he would have known just what
men in each county were at any given time
doing the governing for the people of that
county. That would have required tact and perseverance;
it would have entailed an endless amount
of letter-writing and consulting, and this, amid all
the fascinations of his new life at Washington, was
irksome to him. He knew now too late, the right
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>man in his own county. As to the other counties,
he must still lean on Rankin and trust him. So the
choice as between Pusey and Rankin seemed to be
decided for him.</p>

<p>Rankin came back to Grand Prairie at the end of
the week, and an announcement he then made was
sufficient to excite all the men in the Thirteenth
District who at that time were interested in government.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-VII">VII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ANKIN&rsquo;S announcement was a simple one,
and was made without flourish. It was
merely that at a meeting of the congressional
committee held the day before at Lincoln, a
congressional convention had been called to assemble
at Pekin, on Tuesday of the following
week. The announcement was a surprise to
none more than to Garwood himself. It
reached him in the mysterious way that news
spreads, on his way down town Monday morning,
and, when it was mentioned to him he smiled
blandly with his old cunning as if he had known
it all along. He hastened to his office, and waited
there half an hour before Rankin appeared, perspiring,
florid and expanding with self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, standing an instant in the doorway
and fanning his streaming face with his hat,
&ldquo;think you&rsquo;d lost me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood, not having had time to estimate the
political effect of the move Rankin had made, and
somewhat annoyed with Rankin for not having
told him of his intentions before executing them,
took refuge in the congressional demeanor he had
studied from numerous impressive models in the
District of Columbia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been awaiting a conference with you,&rdquo;
he said. He had also learned at Washington to call
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>meetings where there was to be political scheming,
&ldquo;conferences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rankin, dropping his wide hat to
the floor, &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d see if it could be done first,
and tell you afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I assumed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin glanced at Garwood somewhat uneasily.
He did not like the new mood of Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he assured him, &ldquo;wait till I
tell you. I knew that Sprague and Pusey were at
work, but they needed time. Our play was to force
their hand at once. What we want is a speedy convention
so&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I was not so sure of that,&rdquo; Garwood repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I say yes,&rdquo; said Rankin. &ldquo;Man alive!
They&rsquo;ll skin us; give &rsquo;em time. Anyway Friday
night I wired Sam McKimmon and Jim O&rsquo;Malley
and Joe Hale to meet me Saturday at Lincoln. I
went over and there they were. I told &rsquo;em where
we was at, an&rsquo; what Sprague &rsquo;as doin&rsquo;. They agreed
&rsquo;ith me that we&rsquo;d ought to get a move on, an&rsquo; we
decided quick&mdash;convention fer a week from to-morrow
at Pekin&mdash;Joe insisted on that. I wired Heffron
an&rsquo; Schmidt an&rsquo; Carman las&rsquo; night. It&rsquo;s fixed
now. What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know; if I had had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s the thing when I show you
this. Look&rsquo;e here.&rdquo; He drew a crumpled telegram
from his pocket, struck it open with the back of
his fingers, and handed it to Garwood. &ldquo;Look at
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>Garwood read it. It was a telegram from George
Schmidt, the committee-man from Moultrie
County, voicing an indignant protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, I reckon. Heh?&rdquo; Rankin smiled
triumphantly. &ldquo;Maybe ol&rsquo; Con hain&rsquo;t mad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time Garwood was reassured. If
Sprague was mad, it must be all right, proceeding
on the common assumption that anything which
harasses the enemy is a point gained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said, relentingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said Rankin, smiling more complacently
and triumphantly than ever. &ldquo;Reckon they
won&rsquo;t ketch your Uncle James nappin&rsquo; more&rsquo;n
onct, even if the weather is hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as if he had just reminded himself of the
heat he stripped off his coat, hung it over the back
of his chair and pulled his shirt sleeves far up his
hairy arms for greater comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you select Pekin?&rdquo; Garwood asked,
presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s fartherest from Sullivan fer one
thing, an&rsquo; then Joe Hale wanted to get it fer his
home town. He was a little skeery at first. I had
to fix him&mdash;promised him you&rsquo;d have him appointed
postmaster. You&rsquo;ll have to do it.&rdquo; Garwood
scowled the scowl that comes when the vexed question
of patronage is mooted, but said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rankin went on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to. He
says he can land a delegation from Tazewell all
right. Their county convention&rsquo;s Thursday.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>There&rsquo;s thirty votes to start on. O&rsquo;Malley says Logan&rsquo;s
all right, too. They&rsquo;ll have a mass convention
called fer Saturday. That&rsquo;ll be twenty-four
more&mdash;fifty-four.&rdquo; Rankin leaned over to Garwood&rsquo;s
desk and began to make figures on an old
envelope. &ldquo;Fifty-four,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Mac thinks
he can fetch up his county; that&rsquo;s eighteen more&mdash;seventy-two
in all. With our twenty-two here
that&rsquo;ll make&mdash;le&rsquo;s see, two&rsquo;n&rsquo; two&rsquo;s four&mdash;seven an&rsquo;
two&rsquo;s nine&mdash;ninety-four. An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re nominated, ol&rsquo;
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Rankin, dropping his pencil, slapped Garwood
on the knee, though an instant later he regretted
having taken what once would not have
been a liberty, for he had a sudden intuition that
a new divinity now hedged his congressman. But
he speedily covered his slight confusion by proceeding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; now we&rsquo;ve only got a week to get ready in,
but a week&rsquo;s as good as a month. We must cinch
the thing in Tazewell an&rsquo; Logan an&rsquo; Mason. That
end o&rsquo; the district&rsquo;s our&rsquo;s naturally. We&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em
Piatt an&rsquo; DeWitt; an&rsquo; Moultrie&mdash;course they&rsquo;ve got
that coopered up already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood placed the tips of his fingers together
and knitted his brows in thought. Rankin dutifully
awaited the result of his thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; the congressman said presently,
&ldquo;that we could gain a few more votes here
in Polk? Perhaps, with certain concessions, Pusey
might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>Rankin did not, however, dutifully await the full
expression of the thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Concessions hell!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Concessions to
that little whelp? Well, I should say not! We&rsquo;ll
lick him, an&rsquo; then ram it down his throat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin breathed heavily as he exploded this imperfect
figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to clean that little mess up right now,
onct an&rsquo; fer all,&rdquo; he added, when he could get
breath again. He was puffing in a fat, angry way.
&ldquo;No, sir, you&rsquo;n I&rsquo;ll take a run down to Havana, find
Zeph Bailey, an&rsquo; see if we can&rsquo;t sew up them eighteen
votes from Mason. Then we&rsquo;ll hike up to Pekin
an&rsquo; attend Joe Hale&rsquo;s convention. Then on
Saturday we&rsquo;ll drop into Lincoln, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll make
&rsquo;em a speech. I&rsquo;ll also make a few well chosen
remarks myself&mdash;at the other end o&rsquo; the hall. We&rsquo;ll
concentrate on them counties. Course, it won&rsquo;t do
no harm to make a try in DeWitt an&rsquo; Piatt, but I
don&rsquo;t look fer much there. We only need eighty-three
votes; we&rsquo;ve got ninety-four in sight&mdash;ef none
of &rsquo;em gets away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin had a faculty of reassuring himself, and
the faculty was somehow stimulated after the first
pangs of defeat had been soothed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How sure is Tazewell?&rdquo; Garwood inquired, still
with his finger tips together, his eyes half closed in
cogitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, Joe Hale hain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; to let that
post-office get away from him. You can count on
them thirty sure. Jim thinks Logan&rsquo;s all right&mdash;they
like you over there, you know, an&rsquo; Mac says
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>Mason&rsquo;ll be solid. But we&rsquo;ll have to watch that.
We may lose out there, but I don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;aw,
hell, no!&rdquo; Rankin refused to credit his own fears.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em. Damn it, we must get &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He struck his own knee this time, and with his
fist.</p>

<p>This hasty calling of the convention was like a
bomb-shell in the camp of the Sprague following,
to use one of the war-like expressions that are trite
in our sanguinary partisan politics. Pusey admitted
as much when he wrote daily editorials denouncing
the committee and what he called the snap
judgment it had taken. The announcement, too,
was not received with much favor in the other
counties, for the time in which to call their county
conventions was short, and the politicians were put
to much trouble to form the combinations on which
their own interests depended. But the four men
who had met at Lincoln were a majority of the
committee, and their action was conclusive. The
other members, those from DeWitt, Piatt and
Moultrie Counties had, like the rest, been notified
by telegraph, and even by mail, but Rankin had
taken care to send their telegrams at a late hour,
knowing that the telegraph offices in the little
towns were not open at night. Their letters of
course reached them the next day&mdash;too late for
them to get to the meeting.</p>

<p>And so over the district, the preparations for the
county conventions went forward. Rankin and
Garwood made their trip, and made their speeches,
and when they came home Rankin claimed solid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>delegations from Logan, Mason and Tazewell.
The delegation from Tazewell was instructed for
Garwood; those from Logan and Mason were
not. Rankin also claimed votes in the DeWitt
and Piatt delegations, and formulated such an
elaborate equation that he was able to demonstrate
to any one that Garwood would be nominated
on the first ballot, and with votes to spare.</p>

<p>Pusey made no claims in his newspaper. He
was ever shrewd enough and shifty enough not to
do anything openly that could stultify him in the
future, but Rankin said that telegrams were constantly
passing between him and Sprague. Garwood
did not have his interview with the little
editor. He had thought of it, and had even
broached the subject to Rankin again, but Rankin
was implacable in his hatred and vigorously opposed
any such movement. In the strenuous fight
that was coming on, and even then begun, he displayed
again all of his old commanding resolution,
and Garwood fell under the spell of his strong will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find Jim Rankin a pretty active
corpse!&rdquo; he was continually saying to Garwood.</p>

<p>So the week passed, the county conventions
were all held, and then a silence brooded over
the political camps in the district as the delegations,
like the mobilized detachments of an army,
waited for the time to come when they should
move on Pekin and begin the great battle.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-VIII">VIII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>MILY&rsquo;S baby had had his morning bath, and
after a long wrestle had at last fallen asleep,
his little lips sucking automatically in his
dreams, while her father, after a struggle almost
as wearing, had been induced to go for a morning
walk before the heat of what promised to be a
sultry day should rise with the mounting sun.
She had carried a tray with Jerome&rsquo;s breakfast
up to him, and when he had eaten it he had
rolled over and resumed his snoring, made
more gross by the dissipations of his campaigning
the night before; and now she drew a long
sigh as she sank into her chair on the veranda
to think that a few moments of rest might be
hers at last. She rocked vigorously, as though the
mere physical exercise might rest her fatigued
limbs; the slow motion with which she lifted a stray
lock from her brow and fastened it back in her hair
told how weary she was. In her lap lay a letter
which the postman had just handed her. It was a
large, square envelope, of gray paper, the texture
and tone of which would have told that it was foreign,
even if the German stamp had not already
put that fact in evidence. Emily had recognized
the anglicized writing in which it was addressed
as that of Dade; and the post-mark told that the
travels of the Emersons had led them once more
<span class="pagenum2 hide" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>to Wiesbaden. Emily allowed the letter to lie a
moment unopened in her lap, partly from inertia,
more, perhaps, from a love of anticipating the
pleasure its reading would give her. The breaks
in the vast monotony of her life were so few that
she disliked to have them too quickly over.</p>

<p>And then, she found a charm in the romantic
spell anything that comes out of the Old World
still weaves for us of the New. She loved to picture
Dade, in some smart Parisian gown&mdash;the very
thought of which brought back to her Dade&rsquo;s way
of calling things, especially her own dresses,
&ldquo;<i>chic</i>&rdquo;&mdash;escaping from her hypochondriacal
mother, now with petulant disrespect, now with
gushes of affection, to wander with some young
man down wide avenues, shaded with lindens.
Sometimes she pictured the young man in civilian
dress, but this morning he wore the uniform of the
German army. She could see Dade, trailing her
brilliant parasol over her shoulder, looking up into
his face, and speaking to him in her melodious
French&mdash;no, she corrected her little drama, it
would be this time in her rich German which she
had affected to prefer to French. Some day,
she was sure, these light and transient affairs
would end seriously for Dade, so seriously
that she would find herself enthroned over the
stately household of some old German castle with
a titled military husband. How many years would
then elapse before Dade would be back in Grand
Prairie, with the air of the <i>grande dame</i>, lifting
her lorgnette in the foreign way that would come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>so naturally to her? Would she grow matronly
and have some yellow-haired, outlandish son with
her? Would&mdash;</p>

<p>She heard a noise upstairs, and turned her head
slightly, growing rigid as she listened for the warning
cry of the baby. She waited, but no further
sound came, and she lay back to resume her
dream. But it had been broken, the thought of the
baby had brought her back across all the intervening
seas, back to Grand Prairie and her daily duties
there. She sighed, and languidly tore open the
letter.</p>

<p>When Emily had read the first of the many pages
that made up the letter she laid it down in her lap
to grasp to the uttermost the striking import of its
tidings and there spread over her tired face a new
smile, born of the pleasure women find in that clairvoyance
with which they like to think themselves
gifted in affairs of the heart&mdash;Dade was engaged!
Her morning dream of the moment before had been
prophetic; it was coming true!</p>

<p>Dade wrote of him in her highest vein of ecstasy.
He was not an officer, though he had been, but he
was noble, and Emily gathered that he was in politics,
though Dade did not put it that way. A Prussian
he was, with the sounding name of Baron
Wolf von Waldenburg. He was not rich, though
he had some means, but what he lacked in the aristocracy
of his money he made up by the aristocracy
of his lineage&mdash;an old family, with a seat near
Spandau, and a house in Berlin, where Dade and he
would live. They would have to economize, Dade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>wrote, and try to get along somehow with few servants,
not more than six. Their &ldquo;<i>mnage</i>&rdquo; would be
humble, but Berlin was the <i>dearest</i> place to live.
The baron was in the government there, and of
course they would have the <i>entre</i> to the court circle.
Dear mamma would live with them. Dade
appealed to Emily to know if it was not altogether
too lovely, and as for the baron she was sure that
Emily could not help loving him, he was the dearest
little man that ever lived; so proud, so haughty,
but with such distinguished manners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it funny,&rdquo; Dade raged on, &ldquo;to think
that we both should marry public men? I know
Mr. Garwood would like him&mdash;they would admire
each other&rsquo;s brains anyway. And you must come
and visit us when we are at home in Berlin&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
it sound <i>fine</i>? Just think! While you are
enjoying the gay life of your capital I shall be
enjoying the gay life of mine! Don&rsquo;t you remember
how we always used to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words somehow struck Emily&rsquo;s heart cold.
&ldquo;While you are enjoying the gay life of your capital&mdash;&rdquo;
It was not the expatriation which Dade so
frankly confessed that struck her at first, though a
sense of that came after her own personal pang had
been absorbed in the habitual resignation with
which she accepted the life that was so far from
all her girlish dreams.</p>

<p>The letter became somewhat more coherent as
it progressed. Dade explained that they had come
to Wiesbaden, not this time for her mother&rsquo;s
health so much as for her own. Her physicians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>had advised it; she was run down, and as she was
to be married in the fall, the baron wished her to
be in good health. They might run over to America
before the wedding; she wasn&rsquo;t sure; it would
all depend. And they had not decided yet where
they would be married, certainly, however, not in
Grand Prairie&mdash;there would be no place there for
the baron to stay.</p>

<p>Emily finished the letter, and laid it in her lap
with another sigh. She was all sighs this summer
morning. And yet she could not, and would not,
formulate to herself the reason why she sighed.
She might with impunity have compared her
own life with Dade&rsquo;s, for it was not the life
that Dade was leading for which she sighed that
summer. Once, perhaps, in looking from afar
upon the society life of the cities as it was reflected
in the newspapers, it had seemed to her that she
might be happy there. She recalled having expressed
something of this to a man from Chicago
who had spent a day with her father. He was a
lawyer, with a large practice, but one who nevertheless
gave much of his fine talents to the poor,
the forgotten, and the despised. For this he was
called eccentric, sometimes crazy, often a socialist.
She remembered him always as he sat in her father&rsquo;s
library that evening after dinner&mdash;he had come
down on some business relating to the bank, and
had dined with her father. She remembered his
strong face; a face wondrous in its sympathy, wondrous
in its kindness, wondrous in its sadness. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>seemed to reflect not only all the sorrow he had
seen, but all the sorrow he had perceived in his
deep, penetrating knowledge of life. She always
pictured him as he sat in the library that evening.
She had expressed, in her girlish way, something
of her wish for a larger life, by which she then
meant life in a larger place, and never could she
forget the lift of his gentle eyes, or the smile that
came to his weary visage as he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grand Prairie is as big as Chicago, and a country
cross-roads as big as either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had pondered a long time on those words
and it was long before she had won an inkling of
their meaning. And then she had met Garwood,
and it had seemed that at last she had found the
way to life. She had felt that Jerome was designed
for a big work in the world, and the hand of destiny
had been plainly apparent when he was sent to
Congress. She had dreamed of being by his side in
Washington, a help and an inspiration in the mighty
things he was to do. Now he had been one term
in Congress, and all that his life held seemed to be
an endless scheming and striving to remain there;
the great work he was to do for others altogether
lost sight of in the great struggle for mere existence
in the place he had won. And for her there
was the same old life at home, changed only by
the addition of new cares, of new responsibilities,
the conditions ever growing harder, her perplexities
ever deepening.</p>

<p>But she put Dade&rsquo;s letter back in its square envelope,
and went in. It was growing warm outdoors.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>Her father had come home tired from his
walk; the baby had awakened cross with the heat;
Jerome had got up and was calling her to serve
him in his dressing, and to pack his valise for his
trip to the Pekin convention.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ARWOOD, with Rankin and his other more
intimate supporters started for Pekin on
Monday morning in order to be on the
ground early. They found themselves none too
soon, for the delegates had already begun to gather,
and by night the old town was fully invested by
politicians. They strolled in twos and threes under
their serious hat brims, along the shaded streets
where the wonted quiet of the town deepened to a
repose in which they best could whisper their little
schemes. They were to be found in noisy groups
in the saloons and bar-rooms, but as the chiefs and
leaders were at the hotel, there the interest centered.
Many of the visitors, taking chairs from the
office of the hotel, where the lights, burning under
the low ceiling, made the heat unbearable, placed
them along the curb, and then all through the
summer evening, they tilted back and talked, their
cigars glowing in the darkness, their laughter now
and then breaking on the ears of the youths and
maidens who strolled by. Upstairs in one of the
rooms of the hotel, a poker game was in progress;
in another, Garwood held a levee amid a thick cloud
of cigar smoke, for which the open box of cigars
on the table provided a constant fuel. Sprague also
had his headquarters, and in another room the
congressional committee was in session.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>The room was strewn with paper and the ashes
of cigars, and there was a holocaust of insects on
the floor under the oil lamps, and though the morning
was luminous and still when the meeting ended
the tired and sleepy members were glad of the
breath of its sweet air. The dawn had come long
before. Now the sun was mounting in the east,
flashing his heat in trembling rays down on the
green corn fields. The sky was burnished clean of
clouds, and glistened like metal. Far down in the
west, where the mists had long since rolled away
from the Illinois River, was a low lying hill of cloud,
dazzling white and moveless, resting on the horizon.
As the committee-men, spent with a night of
wrangling, gazed up into that morning heaven they
knew how hot the day would be, a day hot as no
day other than a convention day ever is.</p>

<p>Rankin, as he stood on the hotel steps and gazed,
removed his hat, and wiped his brow with a gesture
of weariness unusual to him. The long strain
of the battle would soon begin. Would it end as
that other battle two years ago had ended? He
had waited long for his reward, he must make one
more winning fight to vindicate his right to it. It
meant much to him&mdash;four years in the post-office
at Grand Prairie&mdash;he could rest when he sat down
in that envied chair. He would move the desk into
the window on Main Street, and then all his friends,
and, what was sweeter still, all his enemies could
see him sitting there. With this dream his habitual
cheerfulness came back to him, and he turned and
went inside with a quicker step. There was still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>work for him to do. The committee was to meet
again at half-past nine to complete the little details,
and, besides, he must prepare a program to place
in the hands of the temporary chairman; a program
on which would be written just what motions
were to be made, who was to move a committee
on credentials and on permanent organization, and
who were to be appointed on these committees, and
then who was to nominate the permanent chairman,
and so forth. Thus it is by such forethoughtful
organization that one chases a thousand, and two
put ten thousand to flight. Rankin went to his room
and with a window open to lure any breeze that
might come with the morning, he wrote out his
schedule of the people&rsquo;s wishes.</p>

<p>Garwood lay snoring in one of the two beds the
room contained. He had remained in his headquarters
until they had been emptied, then he had joined
in a poker game; an hour before Rankin entered he
had fallen heavily into bed.</p>

<p>There, in the morning, Rankin worked on while
Garwood slept. He thought several times, scratching
his head in dilemma, of awaking his leader,
but he forbore and let him sleep. At last he finished,
and then lay down himself, without undressing,
to get what rest he could.</p>

<p>He slept lightly for a time, then awoke. The
sun, already sickeningly hot, was pouring through
the open window, he was bathed in perspiration,
the heat was insufferable.</p>

<p>Garwood roused. While he was washing and
shaving, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will Bailey preside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;we put it through after a fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Rankin, spluttering in the water
he lifted to his face in the bowl of his two palms,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s got nerve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He groped for a towel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you write the resolutions?&rdquo; he asked Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said the congressman; &ldquo;I must do
that.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-X">X</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE convention was to meet at ten o&rsquo;clock, but
at that hour, while the hotel was left desolate,
the Circuit Court room in the old brick
court house where the convention was to sit, was
still empty, and scarcely divested of any of its solemnity
by the chairs that had been set in order for the
accommodation of the representatives of the people
who were to deliberate there. For half an hour the
delegates had been gathering at the somber building,
and now clustered in groups in the historic portico
that had witnessed, so many years before, one
of the great debates between Lincoln and Douglas.
The delegates found the shade grateful, and leaned
against the gray stone columns smoking the cigars
which the candidates had supplied with such prodigal
generosity. With them were many spectators
and the curiosity of these was hardly larger than
the curiosity of the delegates, who, though they had
all the power in their hands, could only speculate,
not as to what they would do with the power, but
what would be done with it for them, and they
awaited the coming of their leaders with a calm,
almost amusing submission to their desires and
designs.</p>

<p>The morning advanced, and with it the heat increased,
until at length some of the delegates, on
whom the deputed dignity of the people sat with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>such weight that they wished to feel some of its
importance by taking their seats, entered the court
room. There they resumed their curious speculations
as to whether Garwood or Sprague would be
nominated, awaiting the advent of some hand
strong enough to gather them all together and mold
them to its own purposes.</p>

<p>But at length and suddenly there was a noise
and in through the doors poured the crowd that
had remained outside, bringing with it a palpable
breath of heat. In the center of the throng was
Jim Rankin, his smiles scattered abroad for all.
He worked his way with heavy shoulders into the
court room, and with an authoritative stride swung
down towards the judge&rsquo;s bench where the presiding
officer of the convention was to wield his gavel.</p>

<p>On the wall the big clock bearing the advertisement
of a local jeweler judicially ticked away three
quarters of an hour before Rankin mounted the
judge&rsquo;s bench. He had been sitting meantime, in
the jury box, whispering to Judge Bailey as composedly
as though the whole convention was not
waiting for him to perform the last rite that would
invoke its political life. He had even removed his
coat, and sat in his rounded white shirt sleeves,
with the self-possession of a judge himself, who
knows that the session of court cannot begin until
he wills it and that none dare show impatience lest
he embarrass his cause. But now and then some
delegate, showing no more respect for Rankin than
the ordinary American freeman really feels for a
judge, however much custom compels him to dissimulate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>in court, would cry: &ldquo;Get a move on you,
Jim,&rdquo; and at last Rankin arose, put on his coat,
whispered a last word to Bailey, and mounted the
raised platform where was ordinarily enthroned the
impersonated authority of the statute in such case
made and provided and the whole peace and dignity
of the people of the state of Illinois.</p>

<p>Rankin&rsquo;s figure showed fine and burly, half of it
towering above the judge&rsquo;s desk, as he looked over
all the heads before him, where, somehow, he was
determined to count eighty-three votes for Jerome
B. Garwood. He stood there huge and powerful
until something of his strength impressed the delegates
before him, until he felt, as they themselves
felt, a moral mastery over their minds. His dignity,
showing in the broad reach of his heavy shoulders,
shining from his sleepless eyes, had in it all
of the accumulated fire of his anger at the opposition
that had dared assail him, and he wished it
to be felt. He singled out Pusey, bowed among
the very men who knew Jim Rankin best, for the
concentration of his gaze. Somewhere he had got
a gavel, as it was supposed, though it was not a
gavel, but a gager&rsquo;s flat mallet, or bung-starter,
ironically symbolic of the real power that lay behind
him, though no one there saw the irony. And
with this in his fat and hairy fist he gave three
heavy raps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention will be in order,&rdquo; he said. The
simple words were the consummation of all the
months of scheming and toiling that had gone before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>in that Thirteenth District, and the delegates
insensibly braced under the idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to make any speech,&rdquo; he began,
and then paused an instant before he added, with
an intense significance, &ldquo;at this stage of the proceedin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some among the delegates caught the threat that
lurked in the statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Rankin went on, &ldquo;the committee has
chosen as temp&rsquo;rary chairman o&rsquo; this convention
Judge Zephaniah P. Bailey of Mason County.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hum of human interest in the crowd.
But Rankin had not done. He still stood there, and
the delegates cocked their ears to hear the rest.
One or two leaders among the Sprague faction rose
to their feet in readiness for parliamentary action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; fer temp&rsquo;rary sec&rsquo;etary, Joseph Hale of
Tazewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly the Sprague leaders began to shout:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their cries were reinforced by the shouts of half
the delegates, the half, approximately, that were
there to vote for Sprague. The Garwood men sat
tight, with soft smiles of satisfaction.</p>

<p>One of Sprague&rsquo;s lieutenants, Randolph, began
an impetuous speech, shaking his fist and a mass
of disordered hair at Rankin. The chairman, however,
mauled the desk with his gavel, and did not
wait for quiet to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll interduce to you your temp&rsquo;rary chairman,
Judge Zephaniah P. Bailey o&rsquo; Mason County.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who, having awaited Rankin&rsquo;s announcement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>at the foot of the three steps that led
to the rostrum, now took the gavel from him, was
tall, and thin and spare. He had walked from the
side to the center of his stage with splay-footed
steps, and now he stood, bent awkwardly, almost
helplessly, over the desk. He was dressed in gray,
ill-fitting clothes, his ready-made coat hanging
from his bony shoulders with that loose absence
of identity which characterizes the garment fashioned
for the type rather than for the individual.
A standing collar, wide open in front,
disclosed a protruding larynx; about the collar was
knotted a stringy cravat of black. His hair was
low parted on the left side, and hung in a great
plume over the right temple. But the man showed
in the face, a face smooth shaven, long and firm,
with its heavy jaw, pointed chin, and level lips cut
straight as the eyebrows that shadowed his eyes.
And it was the eyes that marked and inspired the
face. Small they were, and half closed, so that
at first glance they seemed sleepy, yet when they
opened they could flash sparks from a bright, determined
mind. But always they showed uncommon
shrewdness, and a knowledge of common people
and common things, and now and then they
twinkled with the keen, dry humor sleeping in the
brain that lay behind them. It was beginning to be
observed within the confines of his own county, Mason,
that Zeph Bailey looked like Abraham Lincoln,
a resemblance much prized and sometimes cultivated
by the Illinois politician, with whom the physical
resemblance too often suffices for the moral.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>Judge Bailey, however, was too independent to
care to resemble any other man, even such a man
as Lincoln. He had already had a term as county
judge of Mason, had been a member of the lower
House at Springfield, and was again a candidate
for the Legislature, with ambitions, it was understood,
to be Speaker. There was about this
man, strange, silent, uncouth and awkward in appearance,
that mysterious thing called personal
magnetism, beloved of politicians, even beyond the
boundaries of Illinois, above any resemblance to
Lincoln, and this magnetism was shown the minute
he appeared, for the delegates were silent; they
raised their eyes to him, and the strange spell of his
personality began to play upon them.</p>

<p>Rankin, who had instantly removed his coat
on leaving the rostrum, and seated himself in the
front row of delegates, though not yet with his fellows
from Polk, turned to the man beside him and
whispered, prophetically, reader of men that he
was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to look out fer Zeph Bailey&mdash;he&rsquo;s a
comin&rsquo; man&mdash;smart &rsquo;s a singed cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin&rsquo;s comparison seemed to appeal to his
neighbor, who did not know how commonly it was
employed in Bailey&rsquo;s own home, and he nodded his
instant appreciation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like he had lumbago in the back,&rdquo; the
man added. He was a DeWitt County delegate far
removed from the limits to which Bailey&rsquo;s fame at
that time had spread. And Rankin whispered
back:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he has, it must pain him considerable,
fer his back bone runs clear down to his heels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bailey still stood there, bent painfully, and remained
silent. The hand at the end of a thin wrist
that had never known a linen cuff, held the gavel
at an awkward angle, but an observer would have
noticed that the handle was firm in his fist, and that
when it fell, an instant later, it fell with sharp,
stern blows, not upon its edge, but full upon its
poll, sure sign that a strong man is in the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention&mdash;will be&mdash;in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke in a sharp, penetrating voice, his words
falling strangely into couplets, and then his thin
lips closed firmly again. Hale had come forward
and taken his seat at the old bow-legged table
where the clerk of the court usually sat, and this act
of his seemed to personalize the action of Rankin
in seizing the whole temporary organization, and
so maddened the Sprague men afresh. They had
been willing to tolerate Bailey, partly because of
his strange popularity, partly because of the recognized
precedent that supported Rankin in naming
the temporary chairman. There were precedents
for such a selection of a temporary secretary, also,
as there were precedents for almost everything in
the Thirteenth District, but they had expected a
test vote on the selection of that officer, and they
felt strong then and willing that the issue be
joined. When they saw how they had been balked,
they were angry, and they vented that anger by
shouting at Hale to come away, and now and then
they turned their personalities upon Rankin, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>only smiled, as if he beheld his work and found it
very good.</p>

<p>Bailey cast his inscrutable little eye around the
assemblage, and then rapped with his gavel. His
thin lips moved, and men saw that he was going to
speak. Those who knew him ceased to make noise,
not liking to miss anything Zeph Bailey might say.
In this desire, they pulled at their neighbors and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh! sh! He&rsquo;s going to say something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the partial quiet they were thus enabled to
produce, Bailey drawled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the brethren&mdash;will be&mdash;seated&mdash;another opportunity&mdash;will
be afforded them&mdash;to rise&mdash;for
prayers&mdash;at a later stage&mdash;of the revival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tense quality of the situation was dissipated
in a laugh, though all the possibilities hung undischarged,
electrically, in the hot atmosphere. A
moment longer Bailey waited and then he began his
speech. While he spoke, he stood stooped over the
desk, holding on to his gavel. He spoke all the
way through in those sharp couplets of words,
slowly wrought out. He bowed to custom only
long enough to make the usual adjurations to the
delegates to discharge their high duties faithfully,
and he bestowed the customary partisan praise on
the state administration and on the national administration.
There was applause of course, which
he endured calmly, bent over the desk, waiting for
it to end. But when these formalities had been
observed, he talked to them of common things, like
the heat and the corn crop, and he made jokes about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>the distilleries that lined the Illinois River, and at
his solemn sarcasms the crowd laughed.</p>

<p>Rankin was in high good humor. He had found
a new man, and his beginning augured well for the
success of the convention. When Judge Bailey
stopped, there were cries of &ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Singed Cat rapped instantly with his
gavel and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention&mdash;again&mdash;will be&mdash;in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the speech was done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is&mdash;the further
pleasure&mdash;of the convention?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge uttered this formality with all parliamentary
deference, and the twinkle deep hidden in
his eyes showed that the irony of it was apparent to
him, even if it was lost on the delegates.</p>

<p>The spell of his quaint oratory having been
broken, instantly there was a shuffling of boots, and
a dozen men sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!&rdquo; they chorused.</p>

<p>But Bailey&rsquo;s eyes, having lost the twinkle they
had had when he asked the pleasure of the convention,
now sought the type-written program lying
on the desk before him, that he might be sure of
Rankin&rsquo;s pleasure. And then, his eyes traveling
from one to another of the many flushed faces that
opened upon him, their cold gleam unerringly
rested upon James of the Polk County delegation,
and Bailey said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Polk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said James, hurriedly, &ldquo;I move
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>that a committee on credentials of seven members,
one from each county, be selected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How shall&mdash;the committee&mdash;be appointed?&rdquo; inquired
the chair. Rankin glared rebukingly at
James, and arose to go to him. He detected the
chance of blunder whereby all his plans might go
wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the chair,&rdquo; he growled at James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the chair,&rdquo; James repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo; all the Garwood men
yelled.</p>

<p>Randolph was on his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I move you, sir, as
a substitute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Randolph was ever parliamentary, but Bailey
rapped him to order with the gager&rsquo;s mallet as if
he had been a mere disturbing child, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Polk; seconded by the
gentleman from Tazewell, moves&mdash;that a committee&mdash;on
credentials&mdash;consisting&mdash;of one delegate&mdash;from
each county&mdash;be appointed&mdash;by the chair.
As many&mdash;as favour&mdash;the motion&mdash;will say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman!&rdquo; Randolph was advancing toward
the desk with uplifted arm, his face was very
red and already streaming with perspiration. &ldquo;Mr.
Chairman!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;It has always been the
custom in this district for the delegates to retire by
counties and to select their own members for each
committee. I move you, sir, as a substitute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Moultrie,&rdquo; drawled Bailey,
&ldquo;is out&mdash;of order. Those of you&mdash;who favor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>&mdash;the
motion&mdash;of the gentleman from Polk&mdash;will
say&mdash;&lsquo;Aye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A mighty chorus of &ldquo;Ayes!&rdquo; swelled up from the
mass of delegates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those opposed&mdash;&lsquo;No.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another heavy, deep-throated volume of &ldquo;Noes&rdquo;
burst forth. Instantly Bailey swung his heavy gavel
to his ear, and he said, though still in that deliberate
way of his:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ayes&mdash;<i>seem</i>&mdash;to have it, the ayes&mdash;have it,
and the motion is adopted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then his gavel fell. And as the storm broke
upon him, he stood with the weak stoop in his back,
and looked down on the three score and more of
angry men who were howling at him. His face
never showed sign of emotion, but with his small
eyes blinking slowly, his thin lips closed, he looked
at them, and then began a slow, monotonous, persistent
tap, tap, tap of the gavel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention&mdash;<i>again</i>&mdash;will be&mdash;in order,&rdquo; he
drawled, tapping with his gavel all the while. &ldquo;The
convention&mdash;<i>again</i>&mdash;will be&mdash;in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the storm wore out, and Randolph, and
two or three of his men gathered in a little knot.
After they had held their disheveled heads together
in counsel for awhile, Randolph raised his hand,
and hushed his delegates, and said, when he had
stilled the clamor:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em alone. It&rsquo;ll come out all right. We&rsquo;ve
got the votes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bailey meanwhile had ceased to tap, and now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>stood leaning on the gavel. He began to speak
again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chair&mdash;appoints,&rdquo; he said, his eye leaving
his program and seeking the men he designated
as members of the committee, &ldquo;Messrs. James of
Polk, White of Logan, Kemper of Mason, Brown
of Tazewell, Harrington of DeWitt, Parker of
Moultrie, and Johnson of Piatt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All save Harrington, Parker and Johnson were
Garwood men. The program was then followed,
in choosing by the same process, the committees on
resolutions and on permanent organization. There
too the Garwood men were given the majority,
though Bailey ignored Rankin&rsquo;s program in one
instance, and that was in naming Randolph for the
committee on resolutions, but he did it in some half
humorous notion of his own that Randolph could
there gratify his love for words, and do little harm.
The Garwood men were not particular about the
resolutions, though Rankin gave to Ben Fuller,
Polk County&rsquo;s representative on the committee, a
copy of the platform Garwood had written out.</p>

<p>Noon had come, and was pouring its heat into
the court room. The committees having been chosen,
the convention could do nothing more until
they reported. Bailey therefore said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is&mdash;the <i>further</i>&mdash;pleasure&mdash;of the convention?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Rankin arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I move that we take
a recess until two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>Bailey put the motion and of course it carried.
And then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the convention&mdash;stands adjourned&mdash;until
two o&rsquo;clock this afternoon&mdash;at which hour&mdash;the
riot&mdash;will be&mdash;resumed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His gavel fell.</p>

<p>As he was descending from the platform, Rankin
rushed heavily toward him, and at the same
instant, Randolph also started for him. Before
Rankin could congratulate him, Randolph was talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Zeph, and you, too, Jim,&rdquo; he began
in that curious inofficial tone which men use when
their relations become personal again, &ldquo;we demand
a vote on this permanent organization business. We
ain&rsquo;t going to be shut out altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like my presiding, eh?&rdquo; asked Bailey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d like it all right if it was on my side,&rdquo;
Randolph laughed, &ldquo;but we demand a vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get a vote, Hal,&rdquo; Rankin remarked,
&ldquo;all the vote you want &rsquo;fore you&rsquo;re through&mdash;eh,
Zeph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always aim to treat every one fairly,&rdquo; answered
Bailey.</p>

<p>Randolph looked at him, &ldquo;Aw, come off!&rdquo; he
said, helplessly.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-XI">XI</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE convention assembled at two o&rsquo;clock,
though with the only conspicuous deliberation
that our deliberative bodies display, it
was half-past two before Judge Bailey brought it to
order by a crack of his gavel. The sun had seemed
to hang still on the meridian. The white cloud that
had mounded itself on the horizon in the early
morning had slowly and majestically inflated all the
day, until it covered the whole of the western sky,
where it flashed in the focalized rays of the sun.
Far down at the base of the pile of cloud, an ominous
blackness was spreading, so that the farmers
of the various delegations, trudging along the
sidewalks toward the court house, with their
waistcoats unfastened and their coats on their
arms, prophesied rain, and, drawn out of the differences
of factional feeling into the brotherhood of
husbandry, they welcomed it with reciprocal felicitations
for the common good it would do their
corn. When they reached the court house, the
heat was stifling; the day seemed to stand still
with the sun, and the air they breathed fairly
scorched their nostrils.</p>

<p>The report of the committee on credentials was
received; there were no contests. The report of
the committee on resolutions was read, and the
platform, in the wider partisanship that momentarily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>swallowed up factionalism, applauded. And
then Jim Rankin read the report of the committee
on permanent organization. The report recommended
that the temporary organization be made
permanent.</p>

<p>The sun and the day had seemed to stop, now
time itself paused, for the moment had come. The
fanning delegates stiffened in their hard chairs and
became silent. The heavy air hung heavier still
with suspense. The sun, flaming in through the
tall western windows of the old court room, fell
upon the worn boards of the floor till they smoked
faintly and seemed likely to ignite under the pitiless
fire.</p>

<p>Rankin stood in the very front, near the chairman&rsquo;s
desk, his coat off, his hair curled close and
shining with the perspiration that glistened on
brow and face. He took his cigar from his lips
and raised his big arm in its moist shirt sleeve,
toward Bailey, who leaned wearily, almost sleepily,
over the desk. Rankin&rsquo;s heavy voice broke the
stillness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I move the adoption
of the report.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Randolph meanwhile had arisen slowly, carefully,
as if he feared any noise he made would mar
the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Polk,&rdquo; drawled Bailey, as
if the whole thing wearied him, &ldquo;seconded&mdash;by the
gentleman&mdash;from&mdash;ah&mdash;Tazewell, moves the adoption&mdash;of
the&mdash;report. Aire you ready&mdash;for the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Randolph, heavily and deliberately,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he repeated, knotting
his brows under the mane that hung down to meet
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Moultrie,&rdquo; sighed Bailey.</p>

<p>The delegates leaned forward, intent in their surprise
that Bailey had even recognized the Sprague
leader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; said Randolph, &ldquo;I mean Mr.
Chairman, I move you, sir, as a substitute for the
report of the committee just presented, the following
resolution, which I ask the clerk to read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His use of the words &ldquo;speaker&rdquo; and &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; was
to show the effect of legislative habit.</p>

<p>Bailey only leaned a little farther over his desk,
and then drawled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chair&mdash;will state&mdash;to the gentleman&mdash;from
Moultrie that it is not now&mdash;in order&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two or three men behind Randolph rose halfway
to their feet, protest written in their faces,
but without turning his head, or taking his eyes
from the chairman, Randolph fluttered his hand at
them behind his back and they subsided. It was
plain from his manner that this was a play for position
so delicate, that they must not risk disturbing
it by interrupting their leader. So Bailey continued:
&ldquo;For the gentleman&mdash;to present&mdash;such a resolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; began Randolph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chair&mdash;will add&mdash;for the information&mdash;of
the gentleman&mdash;from Moultrie,&rdquo; Bailey continued,
&ldquo;that&mdash;the only thing&mdash;in order&mdash;at this time&mdash;would
be&mdash;a minority report&mdash;and a motion&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>substitute it, or, again, a motion&mdash;to lay the report&mdash;on
the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; once more began Randolph,
stepping carefully into the aisle, &ldquo;my resolution
is in the very nature of a minority report.
The chair will remember the ruling of Speaker
Haines in the Thirty-fourth General Assembly&mdash;&rdquo;
He was taking higher ground by thus referring to
mysteries known only to him and the chairman.
But Bailey interrupted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chair&mdash;is acquainted&mdash;with the precedent&mdash;to
which&mdash;the gentleman&mdash;refers, and is&mdash;of the
opinion&mdash;that it does&mdash;not properly&mdash;apply&mdash;in
this instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The delegates listened with rapt attention. It
was not often that in their rude, free conventions
they had such parliamentary fine play as this, and
they forgot the heat and the contest to enjoy their
own bewilderment at it. Rankin still stood and
smoked in unconcern. He knew he could safely
leave Randolph to Bailey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And therefore&mdash;the motion&mdash;of the gentleman&mdash;from
Moultrie&mdash;is out&mdash;of order.&rdquo; As Bailey let
his gavel fall, he jerked his head toward Rankin in
signal, and then as the big man heaved himself
near, he leaned over the desk to whisper to him.
Bailey&rsquo;s very action in leaning over the desk, in
removing his eyes from his adversary, in letting
the convention for a moment slip his grasp, as it
were, was audacious. Randolph, again repressing
his followers by the flutter of his hand, smiled with
satisfaction. He took a step farther down the aisle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I appeal from
the decision of the chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And immediately his following, glad at last of a
chance to do something to save the nation and the
day, shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bailey continued to whisper to Rankin a minute
longer, then straightened himself, and looked over
the convention. Rankin was examining the end of
his cigar, and seemed intent on repairing it, for
it had been smoking unevenly and threatening to
come apart, as campaign cigars do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Moultrie,&rdquo; drawled Bailey
at last, &ldquo;appeals&mdash;from the decision&mdash;of the
chair, and the appeal&mdash;is seconded&mdash;by the gentleman&mdash;from&mdash;ah&mdash;was
it Piatt?&rdquo; The humorous
twinkle leaped in Bailey&rsquo;s eye. Those of the delegates
gifted with a sense of humor, remembering
the roar of a moment before, laughed. Randolph,
who had a career in politics before him, and hence
was without that sense, was waiting in the aisle,
taking himself seriously. That Bailey, as was
plain by his manner, had not so taken him, was a
source of chagrin to him and a wound to his pride,
for he and Bailey had served together, he reflected,
in the House! And then Bailey&rsquo;s awful deliberation
maddened him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question, therefore,&rdquo; Bailey resumed, &ldquo;is,
Shall the decision&mdash;of the chair&mdash;stand as the decision&mdash;of
the convention?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused and glanced over the assemblage, and
Rankin, having gone back to his place in the Polk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>County delegation, was now standing with his arm
outstretched toward the chair. Presently Bailey&rsquo;s
eye roved to where Rankin stood, and Rankin said,
in the low tones that betoken an understanding
with the presiding officer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Polk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I move to lay the appeal on
the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Polk,&rdquo; said Bailey, &ldquo;seconded&mdash;by
the gentleman&mdash;from Mason&mdash;moves to
lay&mdash;the appeal&mdash;on the table. Aire you ready&mdash;for
the question? As many&mdash;as favor&mdash;the motion&mdash;will
vote&mdash;&lsquo;Aye&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great volume of &ldquo;Ayes&rdquo; rolled from the
throats of the Garwood delegates, while the
Sprague delegates began to cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roll-call! Roll-call! Roll-call!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Randolph had advanced down the aisle until
he was opposite Rankin. His mane was tossing
savagely, his face was aflame and as he shook his
fist at Bailey his lips moved rapidly, though his
hot words were lost in the general din. All the
while Bailey calmly looked on, and kept up a careless
tap, tap, tapping with his gavel. The spectators
who had hung in the rear of the court room
pressed forward among the delegates. Randolph
approached to the very desk and shook his fist
under Bailey&rsquo;s imperturbable, long nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised us a roll-call, and you&rsquo;ve got to
be fair and give us a show! If you don&rsquo;t, damn you,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>Bailey hung far over the desk now and said in
his drawl:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hal Randolph, you damned&mdash;little sucker&mdash;you,
if you don&rsquo;t go&mdash;sit down&mdash;and behave yourself&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
have&mdash;to lam&mdash;you one&mdash;with this mallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he calmly resumed his tapping. After
awhile, his persistence won silence, and he slowly
wriggled in his ill-fitting garments as if they were
really as uncomfortable as they looked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention&mdash;again&mdash;will be&mdash;in order,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Randolph assisted in quieting his band.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the convention&mdash;will permit&mdash;the chair&mdash;will
explain&mdash;the parliamentary situation&mdash;in which&mdash;the
convention&mdash;now finds itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused and silence hung again upon his
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Polk&mdash;presented&mdash;a report&mdash;from
the committee&mdash;on permanent organization&mdash;and
moved&mdash;its adoption. The gentleman&mdash;from&mdash;ah&mdash;Moultrie&mdash;then
offered&mdash;a resolution.
That resolution&mdash;the chair&mdash;declared&mdash;to
be&mdash;out of order. Thereupon the gentleman&mdash;from
Moultrie&mdash;appealed&mdash;from the decision&mdash;of
the chair. That appeal&mdash;the gentleman&mdash;from Polk&mdash;moved&mdash;to
lay&mdash;upon the table. The question,
therefore, recurs&mdash;upon the motion&mdash;of the gentleman&mdash;from
Polk&mdash;to table&mdash;the appeal. Upon
that question&mdash;the yeas and nays&mdash;or, rather, a
roll-call&mdash;of the delegations&mdash;has been&mdash;demanded.
Those of you&mdash;who favor&mdash;the motion&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>is, those of you&mdash;who favor&mdash;tabling the appeal&mdash;and
the adoption&mdash;of the report&mdash;of the
committee on permanent organization&mdash;will vote&mdash;&lsquo;Aye,&rsquo;
and those&mdash;opposed&mdash;will vote&mdash;&lsquo;No&rsquo;&mdash;upon
the polling&mdash;of your respective&mdash;delegations,
and the secretary&mdash;will call&mdash;the roll&mdash;of the counties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gavel fell, and Randolph turned, smiling
complacently as one who had already won his
fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vote No!&rdquo; he called to simplify the issue for
his men.</p>

<p>And Rankin shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vote Aye, boys; vote Aye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The delegations gathering in little groups were
polled amid a hum of busy interest. Bailey had
seated himself and looked with sleepy unconcern
down on the mass of men, tearing up their little
slips of paper and dropping them in the black
slouch hats of southern Illinois. Once he moved,
and beckoned to him a man from his own delegation,
and cast his ballot with the Mason fellows.
At last the hats were reposing between knees, the
ballots were counted. Bailey slowly arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you all voted?&rdquo; he asked. The silence acquiesced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The secretary&mdash;will call&mdash;the roll&mdash;of the
counties.&rdquo; And then intensity hung again in the
air. Hale called off the names of the counties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;DeWitt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighteen votes No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Logan?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirteen votes Aye, eleven votes No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sprague men clapped their hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighteen votes <i>Aye!</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Randolph turned and knit his brows. Then he
smiled again. He was keeping tab on his knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moultrie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifteen&mdash;N-o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piatt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifteen votes No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The silence was absolute. Rankin and Pusey
had been wrangling. Pusey announced the vote.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-two Yeas and twenty-three Nays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was cheering from the Sprague men and
the gavel cracked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tazewell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty votes&mdash;<i>Aye!</i>&rdquo; shouted Carlin, one of
Joe Hale&rsquo;s men, drawing out the affirmative unctuously.
He was thinking of Joe&rsquo;s job.</p>

<p>Then, while the convention awaited the result,
Hale figured painfully. Rankin stepped up to help
him. The Sprague men howled an objection and
Randolph advanced to a place near the secretary.
But Hale figured under the shelter of his palm.
When he had done, he handed the slip up to the
chairman. Bailey examined it attentively an instant,
a long instant, then the convention grew impatient
and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to us! Give it to us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bailey waited, again studying the slip. And at
last, holding it in his fingers, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On this vote&mdash;the Yeas aire&mdash;eighty-three, and
the Nays&mdash;aire eighty-two, and the motion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Randolph was standing in the aisle, his finger
poised, his lips apart, his eyes blazing. His face
glowed with a delight he could not conceal as he
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman! A point of
order!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bailey paused and looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, wearily, &ldquo;the gentleman&mdash;may
state&mdash;his point of order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the silence, again the interest in this fencing
between the two parliamentarians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My point of order, Mr. Chairman, is this:&rdquo; Randolph
kept his forefinger in its parliamentary
poise. &ldquo;The delegation from Mason County cast
eighteen votes in the affirmative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bailey nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I believe, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; Randolph went
on, taking his time, that he might uncover his point
slowly and thus make it the more effective in the
end, &ldquo;that the chair is a member of the Mason
County delegation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;is eminently&mdash;correct,&rdquo; said
Bailey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Randolph, raising
his voice for his climax, &ldquo;as the chair&rsquo;s delegation
cast its full vote, the chair evidently voted on this
proposition, and the chair is not entitled to a vote
on an appeal from his own decision. With the
vote the chair improperly cast eliminated, the result
would be a tie, and therefore the motion would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>not prevail. Hence my point of order; which
amounts to a challenge of the chair&rsquo;s vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sprague men began to laugh uproariously,
and to applaud while Randolph stood in the aisle
in his statesmanlike attitude, enjoying his triumph.
And as their laugh began to subside Bailey&rsquo;s face
wrinkled into a strange annoying smile. His little
eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Moultrie&mdash;is correct,&rdquo; he
began. And there was a shout. He indulged it
to the echo, and then went on: &ldquo;But unfortunately&mdash;for
the gentleman&mdash;from Moultrie, however fortunately&mdash;for
the chair, this is not&mdash;a vote&mdash;on an
appeal, but&mdash;on a motion&mdash;to lay&mdash;an appeal&mdash;on
the table. The chair, if not misinformed, has the
right&mdash;to vote&mdash;on all motions&mdash;to table;&mdash;and on
this motion&mdash;the chair&mdash;votes &lsquo;Aye,&rsquo; the motion
prevails, and the appeal&mdash;is laid&mdash;on the table!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He swung the gavel up and let it fall, and the
Garwood men began to cheer. Randolph looked
dazed, and was about to speak. But Bailey, striking
order again with his gavel, went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question&mdash;now recurs&mdash;upon the motion&mdash;of
the gentleman&mdash;from Polk&mdash;that the report&mdash;of
the committee&mdash;be adopted. As many&mdash;as favor&mdash;the
motion&mdash;will say&mdash;&lsquo;Aye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a mighty shout, &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As many&mdash;as are opposed&mdash;will vote&mdash;&lsquo;No!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sprague men yelled &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&mdash;an equal volume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ayes&mdash;seem&mdash;to have it,&rdquo; said Bailey, &ldquo;the
ayes&mdash;have it, and the motion&mdash;prevails.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>The gavel fell. The Sprague men sat dumb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the temporary&mdash;organization&mdash;therefore
becomes&mdash;the permanent organization&mdash;of this
convention,&rdquo; said Bailey, speaking as if he were
merely resuming some sentence that all the confusion
of balloting had interrupted, an interruption
to him of no more importance than the pauses he
made in his words. Thus the Garwood men secured
the control of the convention and won the
first round.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-XII">XII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE sun poured its rays now on a dead level
through the unwashed glass of the western
windows; the dust beaten out of the old floor
by the stamping feet of Garwood&rsquo;s successful cohorts
quivered in its beams. The storm, promised
early in the afternoon, had inconsequently vanished
after some unvindicated mutterings of its prophetic
thunder, and left the town hotter than ever. The
air was oppressed with heavy humidity, and the
farmer delegates, dreaming vaguely of their corn,
beheld it drying in the heat, rattling its yellow
leaves. In the crowded court room the delegates
languished in their shirt sleeves, the collars of
those who still wore collars, wilted into moist and
shapeless masses at their throats. The fight had
beaten the life out of them, even those who were
radiant in victory. Some one, a Sprague man,
moved an adjournment. But Rankin frowned and
shouted, &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; to his followers. He had just
then an advantage he did not care to lose. And
so, when the motion was put, the Singed Cat,
glancing at the solemn judicial clock and seeing
that two hours of the afternoon yet remained, declared
it defeated, and then he drawled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nominations&mdash;of candidates&mdash;for representative&mdash;in
Congress&mdash;aire now&mdash;in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had said this, he seemed glad to sit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>down, though he alone of all the others was unperturbed
by that awful heat, and wore his ill-fitting
coat as though he would preserve the decorum
of the occasion, as Napoleon, for example to his
men, wore his uniform buttoned to the chin while
he led them across the hot sands of Egypt.</p>

<p>The tired and exhausted delegates settled down
gloomily to hear the nominating speeches. Some
of them showed an intention of slipping out of the
court room, lured by thought of the cooling
drafts of beer in the saloons that presented their
fronts eagerly to the very face of the temple of
Tazewell County justice, but the bosses of either
side, fearing some advantage might be taken of
their absence, held them to their posts. And so
they listened to the impassioned speech into which
Randolph was able to work himself in placing in
nomination the name of &ldquo;that profound jurist, that
able statesman, that honest man, Conrad
Sprague!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then followed Dorsey, whom Rankin had
chosen for the honor of naming his candidate.
Every one knew of course whom Dorsey was presenting,
and yet he treasured his name as a hidden
surprise for his closing sentence; in which he epitomized
him as &ldquo;the tall Sycamore of the Sangamon,
whose eloquence still reverberates in the
halls of national legislation, whose fame is growing
brighter and fairer as the days go by, in honoring
whom the people of the Thirteenth District,
representing as it does the pride and glory of central
Illinois, are but honoring themselves&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>champion of popular rights, that man of the common
people, our present representative, the Honorable
Jerome B. Garwood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were speeches seconding these nominations,
and applause following them, carefully apportioned
by the supporters of each, and then when
all had done, when every one thought the last word
had been spoken, when the Singed Cat had arisen,
leaned over the desk and inquired:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aire there&mdash;any other&mdash;or further&mdash;nominations?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grant Knowlton of Lincoln arose and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because it was unexpected, the common phrase
fell upon their ears with a dramatic force. The
delegates scraped about to face the new speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Logan,&rdquo; said the Singed
Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; Knowlton began, &ldquo;and gentlemen
of the convention: Old Logan brings you
from her ripening corn fields, from her sun-kissed
prairies, from her populous towns, the name of her
favorite son. She comes, Mr. Chairman, bringing
you a man who ranks foremost in the affections of
the citizens of the thriving city which the great
Emancipator himself laid off with his own chain
and compass, that now repose as honored relics in
his hallowed tomb in Springfield, the town to which
he gave his own name, who has never sought the
consideration of his neighbors but has always had
it; who stands to-day among her leading men, who,
in the great hour of national peril when the skies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>were dark, went forth to help strike the shackles
from the bleeding limbs of four millions of human
beings, who has since served his country equally
as well if in an humbler capacity.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Knowlton poured forth his sentences so rapidly
that the delegates scarce could follow them, and
filled with curiosity as they were, they could not
determine from his mixed relatives whether he was
about to nominate Abraham Lincoln himself, or
some man of a later, and if not an abler, at least a
livelier generation. The young lawyer felt that he
had at last his opportunity, and he was seizing it.
He had cleared a space among the chairs about
him, and in this he strode back and forth, waving
his arms, and shaking his head so fiercely that his
black locks flapped, and his face became a mere
red blur. The young man had a deep resonant
voice, and its tones vibrating to his own passion
thrilled at last the hearts of the men who listened,
a physical manifestation in which is to be found
doubtless the success of much oratory. So he was
kept on fire by cheers. But at last, the curiosity to
know who was this new Richmond in the field, as
Charlie Cowley called him in his despatches the
next morning, this new Richmond who took them
by such surprise and so thoroughly destroyed their
calculations, grew beyond mastery, and the youth&rsquo;s
periods were marred by cries of:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name him! Name him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The interruption did not fluster the young orator.
Men all about him were straining to catch the first
accents of the name of this dark horse from Logan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>County, farther away old men placed their hands
behind their ears to aid their hearing, still farther
off delegates leaned anxiously forward, with brows
knit in a painful intensity. Young Knowlton took
it all as a tribute to his oratory, and his really fine
voice, a voice that would carry any man far in
public speaking, rolled to the ceiling of the old
court room. The Singed Cat alone remained impassive
and cold. Rankin and Randolph stood and
hung on his words, trouble written in their faces.
But Knowlton was exhausting himself. His deep
voice grew husky, the perspiration streamed from
his face, his breath came in a vapor from his mouth,
hot as the atmosphere was. At last it was plain
that he had worn himself out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I name him?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Shall I name
this peerless son of old Logan, who in every hour
of public need has been ready to answer the call
of public duty? He is known to you all, he is
known to every one in the seven counties that
comprise this agricultural empire of the Thirteenth
District. Aye, his fame has spread beyond her
confines, it is written on the pages where are enrolled
the glorious names of those who fought the
nation&rsquo;s battles, it is emblazoned in the fair temple
of civic triumph. We bring you a leader, Mr.
Chairman, to harmonize all your differences, to
cement the grand old party for another mighty
onward march to victory, who will plant your flag
as he has planted that proud emblem of a free people,
the glorious stars and stripes, on the ramparts
of the routed and flying enemy. Nominate him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>gentlemen, and in the Ides of November, when the
ballots come</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">&ldquo;&lsquo;down as still<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As snow-flakes fall upon the sod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But execute a freeman&rsquo;s will<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As lightning does the will of God,&rsquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p>he will be found to have been elected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Knowlton sank into his chair, gasping for
breath, his chest heaving with the violence of his
exertion. The delegates looked at him and at
one another a moment in surprise, and then they
began to cry all at once:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t name him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us his name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knowlton sprang to his feet; for an instant he
stood and looked helplessly around. His face
flamed a deeper crimson and he said in a hoarse,
tired voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our candidate, gentlemen&mdash;his name is General
William M. Barrett.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anti-climax produced a laugh which relieved
the tensity of the situation.</p>

<p>Knowlton sank into his chair again and was
mopping his neck with his handkerchief. The
members of his own delegation pressed about him
in congratulation. Moist hands were thrust at him
from all sides. Rankin himself strode back and
offered his felicitations. Knowlton smiled, and
shook his head in depreciation of his own effort.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>Some one thought to second the nomination of
Barrett, and the Singed Cat arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aire there&mdash;any other&mdash;or further&mdash;nominations?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;If not&mdash;the nominations&mdash;aire
now&mdash;closed. The delegates will prepare their ballots&mdash;and
the secretary&mdash;will call&mdash;the roll&mdash;of the
counties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The interest tightened. Delegations assembled
close to their leaders, and hats were passed for the
ballots. The supreme moment had come.</p>

<p>Knowlton thought to create a sensation by his
speech; he created a greater by his nomination.
The Logan County delegation had been promised
to Rankin by Jim O&rsquo;Malley, but when at the
county convention in Lincoln O&rsquo;Malley had been
unable to secure a Garwood indorsement, Rankin
had feared the result there, and his fears had been
confirmed when he could not induce the full delegation
to cast its solid vote for his plan to make
the temporary organization permanent. Their action
in dividing on that question had placed their
twenty-four votes in the doubtful column, and now
that they had seen fit to spring a candidate at the
last moment, they had injected an uncertain element
into the calculations of both sides that perplexed
the leaders. Rankin had hoped to hold his
eighty-three votes together that afternoon and
nominate Garwood on the first ballot. Now he
saw that this would be impossible. A long, stubborn
fight was before him, and he had a candidate,
as he recognized himself, though by no means
would he admit it, who would not gain in strength
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>as the hours passed by. At that moment he felt
that he was stronger than he ever would be again.
That was why he had refused to let the convention
adjourn.</p>

<p>General Barrett, whom the Logan County delegation
had thus brought out, was, while not all perhaps
that Knowlton had described him, nevertheless Lincoln&rsquo;s
leading man. He was popular in his own
community, he had amassed, if not strictly in his
practice of the law, yet in the opportunities that
practice opened to him, a comfortable competency.
He had gone to Lincoln in an early day; he had
led a regiment to the Civil War, and had come
out of the army with a clean if not a brilliant
record, and in the general distribution of brevets
immediately following the close of the mighty conflict
he had shared to the extent of an honorary
brigadier-generalship. He had then gone home
to resume his quiet life, and by carefully pursuing
a middle course in all things, and avoiding the
making of enemies, he had gradually built up a
reputation for honesty and integrity that made
him an ideal figure of the colorless, eminently respectable,
safe and conservative citizen. He had
been a strict, though not an aggressive party man,
and whenever Logan County wished a name to
juggle with in conventions, they chose the name
of General William M. Barrett, knowing that he
would not object, and so long as he was not
nominated, that no one else could object. He
had never been elected to an office of profit, and
he had never been an avowed candidate for any,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>though he had served on the school board and on
all the public committees, in addition to being invited
to deliver orations on Decoration Day, yet
he was ever in a calm and receptive mood, and
while Logan County delegations had never gone
so far as to nominate him for anything, he seemed
never to doubt the sincerity of their support. But
there comes a time in the career of the men whose
names are continually before conventions when
the lightning strikes them, and both Rankin and
Randolph saw that the present hour was charged
with just such a possibility.</p>

<p>The delegates had voted and now sat awaiting
the delivery of the first ballot. Hale began to call
the roll of the counties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;DeWitt?&rdquo; Hale called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighteen votes for Conrad Sprague.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Logan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Malley was up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on behalf of the solid
delegation from Logan County I cast twenty-four
votes for General William M. Barrett.&rdquo; O&rsquo;Malley
winked at Rankin as he sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; cried McKimmon, emulative
of O&rsquo;Malley, &ldquo;on behalf of the solid delegation
from Mason County I have the honor to cast her
eighteen votes for our present able congressman,
Honorable Jerome B. Garwood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Rankin started a cheer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moultrie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Randolph was standing prominently in the middle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>aisle, or what had been an aisle early in the
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he said, in heavy tones, &ldquo;Moultrie
County gives her fifteen votes to our <i>next</i>
congressman, Honorable Conrad Sprague.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the Sprague delegations cheered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piatt?&rdquo; the roll-call proceeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sprague fifteen votes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin had taken a seat, and sat with his fat
elbows on his fat knees. He had been keeping the
count in his mind, as Randolph had been keeping
it on a scrap of paper. He knew what he had, and
he knew that when Sprague received the twenty-three
votes Pusey would deliver to him, Sprague
would be in the lead. Pusey had passed his old
straw hat for the ballots, and it had ground Rankin
to have to drop his own vote in it, held as it
was by the man who now usurped the place in
the Polk County delegation he had held for so
many years. Pusey arose, and his thin voice piped:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, Polk County casts twenty-two
votes for Garwood, and twenty-three for Barrett.&rdquo;
Rankin looked up. Randolph, who had
been preparing to order a volley of cheers for his
candidate, stood stricken dumb. The vote came
as a surprise to everybody, but more than all to
the Logan County men. They were nonplussed.
They had nominated Barrett with a little more,
perhaps, than their usual sincerity, but they had
merely gone to him temporarily in order to put
themselves in a controlling position between the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>other two candidates. Pusey, who had been counted
for Sprague by all, now held the balance of
power. Hale looked up as if there had been some
mistake. At last Rankin, smiling sardonically, and,
as it were, to himself, arose and lumbered into the
aisle near Randolph. As he steered past the
Sprague leader, still dumbfounded, he said, with no
attempt to conceal his words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you, Hal, you couldn&rsquo;t depend on the
little cuss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Singed Cat smote his gavel down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention&mdash;will be&mdash;in order. Let&mdash;the
roll-call&mdash;proceed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tazewell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty votes for Garwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then while Hale was footing his three little
columns, conversation hummed again among the
delegates.</p>

<p>Pusey sat quietly tracing his mysterious figures
on the floor with the point of his little stick.</p>

<p>Rankin had paused by Hale&rsquo;s table where
Cowley sat. Rankin smiled down on the correspondent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Case o&rsquo; buy, heh?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cowley shrugged his shoulders expressively, like
a foreigner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Rankin repeated, his teeth showing
in a broad significant grin.</p>

<p>Hale had written the result on a slip of paper
and passed it up to Bailey. The Singed Cat took
it, and studied it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this ballot,&rdquo; he began presently, &ldquo;there have&mdash;been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>cast&mdash;one hundred and sixty-five votes;
necessary&mdash;to a choice, eighty-three. Of these
Mr. Garwood&mdash;has&mdash;received&mdash;seventy, Mr.
Sprague&mdash;forty-eight, and General Barrett forty-seven.
No candidate&mdash;having received&mdash;the necessary
number&mdash;of votes, there has been&mdash;no nomination&mdash;and
you will, therefore&mdash;prepare your
votes&mdash;for another ballot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; Rankin said, with a promptness
that recognized the change in the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Polk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I move that the convention do
now adjourn until to-morrow morning at nine
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The motion prevailed. The sun was a red ball,
hanging low beyond the river. It seemed that the
hour was the hottest of the afternoon. Pusey was
sitting there moving his wrinkled jaws and puckered
lips over his tobacco, as inscrutably as the
Singed Cat himself might have done, had he
chewed tobacco. It would take a night to find the
bearings that had been lost that afternoon.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-XIII">XIII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ENERAL BARRETT, hearing from Pekin
that his county&rsquo;s delegation had taken pardonable
liberties with his name at the convention,
arrived on an evening train, and though
his quiescent absence would have suited his supporters
better, they welcomed him at the old station
with as much enthusiasm as they could generate
on so short a notice. The general drove to the
hotel in a carriage, and when he entered the office
bowed seriously, playing well the part of the distinguished
and respectable leader whom the voice
of the people had summoned. To Cowley, who
interviewed him when his headquarters had been
opened, he said solemnly that he was in the hands
of his friends, that he considered this a fair field
and an open contest, and esteemed his own opportunities
to be as favorable as those of either of the
other distinguished and able candidates.</p>

<p>All through the hot night the rooms of the three
candidates blazed. Delegates hung about them as
the nocturnal bugs wheeling in on heavy wing
from the darkness outside fluttered around the
coal oil lights, though not all of them stuck as
closely to the flame that had brought them thither
as did those hapless insects whose tragic fate matted
their wings at last to the oily glass bowls of
the lamps. The general remained in his room,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>democratically, where all could see him and grasp
his hand, and doubtless derived as much satisfaction
from these little levees as if he were holding
larger and more significant ones. Both Sprague
and Garwood had other rooms opening off those
where the public were invited to gather and participate
freely in the distribution of campaign
cigars that stood in boxes on the center tables.</p>

<p>Garwood sat on the tumbled bed in his inner
room, pale and haggard. A cigar fumed constantly
in his teeth. A tray of whisky glasses lay on the
table. With Garwood were Rankin and Bailey.
They had gone over the situation again and again.
Delegate after delegate had been led in to interview
the congressman, every argument, every persuasion,
every threat that the three men could devise
had been used. But they made no appreciable
headway. They had seventy votes and they felt
that they could hold them, for Rankin vouched for
the twenty-two men from Polk, the Singed Cat
was calmly certain of his eighteen votes from Mason,
and Hale scouted the idea of any one of the
thirty Tazewell fellows failing. The remaining
voles were so evenly divided between Garwood&rsquo;s
opponents that each would hesitate to go to the
other. Any coalition with the Sprague men was
impossible; they were as determined as Garwood&rsquo;s
own. They must look for strength to the Barrett
following. They considered Pusey, and the twenty-three
votes he controlled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see him, Jim?&rdquo; Garwood suggested
to Rankin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>The big man spat and shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;uld do no good fer me to see him. I&rsquo;d hate
to speak to the little cur, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, look here, Jim, you mustn&rsquo;t let any personal
feeling stand in the way of our success,&rdquo; Garwood
snarled. He was growing peevish from the
heat, the strain, the anxiety. Rankin laughed, as
if at the whim of a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry &rsquo;bout me, Jerry,&rdquo; he said. He
had dropped back into his own old way of calling
Garwood by his familiar name since the contest for
renomination had brought the congressman down
to the hard earth again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play my end of the
game. Let Zeph here see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They considered in turn the twenty-four men
from Logan County. O&rsquo;Malley was sent for, and
came, half fearfully, reporting that his hands were
tied by the exigencies of affairs in his own county.
He was half afraid to be seen at Garwood&rsquo;s headquarters,
lest suspicion stab him, though a combination
by which Garwood, when he knew his
own chances were gone, would throw his strength
to Barrett was the one practical thing to do.</p>

<p>With such man&oelig;uvering the night wore away.
Garwood could reach no agreement with the Barrett
men. Bailey saw Pusey, but the little editor
was wily, he was playing some strange game of
his own, and he sent word that if Garwood wished
to see him, to come himself. What his game was
none of them could find out; they did not think
him at all sincere in his support of Barrett, and
hourly feared that he might draw Barrett&rsquo;s forces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>into the Sprague column. Meanwhile, Pusey&rsquo;s
political attitude was that of one who had simply
taken refuge in the peaceful eddy that swam in
the wake of Barrett&rsquo;s utter respectability and availability,
until some definite turn should be taken
by the current. Towards morning some of the
tired delegates declared truces, and arranged poker
games. Their clicking chips could be heard on
all that second floor of the hotel. And some of
them went out under the purple sky of a summer
night, a sky studded with brilliant stars. Leo was
low in the west, the moon swam in a sea of silver
along the horizon. They heard the calming voice
of insects, they felt the breeze of the night on their
brows.</p>

<p>The morning came, with its brazen sky. Once
more the white clouds mounted in the west as if
trying again for rain, and the day wore on like
the one before, without change. The sun blazed
on high, seeming to shrink in its own fierce dazzling
concentration as it flashed its rays into that
hot court room where the convention sat and balloted,
one ballot after another, until a hundred,
two hundred, five hundred, had been taken, until
the floor was strewn with paper and discolored
by tobacco, the air heavy with smoke, the feculence
of all their breathing, the acrid smell of perspiration.
The sky darkened, and those tired men
sighed for rain. The thunder rolled down the valley
of the Illinois, and then ceased. The sky
cleared, and the heat increased. And all the while
the ballots which Hale announced were the same:</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-XIV">XIV</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HURSDAY came and another day with its
oppressive heat and even more oppressive
suspense wore away; and still another came
and wore away like the one before it. The week
was marching by, and the delegates were no nearer
a choice than when they first began. The convention
had taken twelve hundred and sixty ballots;
more than had been taken at the Clinton convention
two years before. Still the ballot was unchanged,
Garwood seventy, Sprague forty-eight,
Barrett forty-seven.</p>

<p>Evening came, and the delegates, drawn and
spent, refused to hold a night session. They
trudged back to the hotel, and resumed the tiresome
rounds of the headquarters, the fruitless conferences,
the profitless scheming. They gathered
in groups in the hotel office, filling the air with
their cigar smoke. The noise of conversation ascended
to the floors above, but it no longer was
lightened by laughter; now it had a harsh, angry
note of contest. Surely the strain could not last
much longer. It must end as must the insatiable
heat.</p>

<p>Up in Garwood&rsquo;s room they had tried all their
arts again, and again they had all proved unsuccessful.
They had approached Pusey, and he had
shuffled away with his impenetrable air, they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>sounded the Logan County delegation, but found
that the whim which had led it to bring out Barrett
had now developed, under the pressure of the
long unbroken deadlock, into an unaccountable
opposition to Garwood, that had in it all the bitterness
of a personal aversion. The Sprague men,
of course, were utterly out of the question, and the
only consolation they had was that Garwood was
still in the lead, and that his delegates, upon being
canvassed once more, declared that they would
&ldquo;go down into the last ditch with Jerry.&rdquo; To Garwood
it seemed that they were in the last ditch
then. Each new step in the hall seemed to him
the coming of the news that Sprague and Barrett
had coalesced. He felt the need of instant action.</p>

<p>The strain was telling even on Rankin, but he
was never idle. Most of the men in Garwood&rsquo;s
rooms had visibly relaxed, and some one, feeling
no doubt that they were about to settle down to
one of those long deadlocks that last for weeks,
had suggested a game of poker, and had asked
Rankin to join in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my work to do. I must
see some fellers to-night. You boys play, though,&rdquo;
he added in his kindly way. &ldquo;The judge here&rsquo;ll play
with you. You play, don&rsquo;t you, Zeph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the Singed Cat drawled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better&rsquo;n
a&mdash;green hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they got out the chips. It all irritated
Garwood beyond endurance. He slung on his coat
savagely, and seized his hat. For them to sit
calmly down to play cards while he was in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>clutch of circumstance, was more than he could
bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out awhile,&rdquo; he flung at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jerry,&rdquo; said Rankin, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
thing for you to do. The exercise&rsquo;ll do you good.
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to see O&rsquo;Malley after while&mdash;I&rsquo;ll look
after things. Stay long&rsquo;s you want."</p>

<p>And Garwood left, swearing. Down the hallway
he heard the click of the chips of other games; at
Barrett&rsquo;s room he had a glimpse of the old man
sitting in all his dignity with some of the boys
from Logan County leaning over him. Sprague&rsquo;s
door, too, was open; he caught the laughter within,
and as he passed, he suddenly beheld O&rsquo;Malley
and Knowlton talking with Randolph. The scene
was etched on his mind, the three men standing
there in the bright light, the hats of O&rsquo;Malley and
Knowlton thrown back, Randolph bareheaded, his
coat and waistcoat off, his long cravat unknotted,
and dangling over his soiled bosom. As he passed
he heard Knowlton say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then, Hal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood hastened on. Hot as the little old
hotel was, he broke into a cold sweat. The very
thing he had feared was coming to pass! And
they were so open about it, too!</p>

<p>His first thought was to turn back and rouse
Rankin, but a strange childish fear of Randolph
seized him, a morbid dread of being seen by any
of his opponents just then, and he kept on.</p>

<p>When he reached the head of the stairs, Garwood
saw Pusey shambling across the office, tapping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>his little cane on the floor, as a blind man
might, though he did it meditatively, as if he were
striking at the crawling flies instead of the cockroaches
from which he was separated. Garwood
stiffened at the sight of this old enemy. His breath
came fast, his cold sweat was succeeded by a flush
of heat, and then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pusey!&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>The editor turned. His quick eye caught the
congressman on the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heh?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Garwood descended, with dignity now, for he
was emerging into public view again. The editor
drew slowly toward the staircase. They met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for a little walk&mdash;thought maybe the
night air might refresh me. Care to go along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care if I do,&rdquo; said Pusey.</p>

<p>The office was deserted by all save the landlord
who snoozed behind his counter, the insects that
buzzed around the lamps, and the flies that walked
like somnambulists across the ceiling, and on the
walls. The two men sauntered carelessly toward
the side door.</p>

<p>Once outside Garwood sniffed in eagerly the
night air that bathed his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a bit cooler?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know but it is,&rdquo; acquiesced Pusey. &ldquo;Heat
don&rsquo;t bother me much, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sky was black overhead, not a star was to
be seen. In the west, now and then, a glare of
heat lightning trembled over all the sky, photographing
for them instantly the strange roofs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>the strange chimneys, the black outline of strange
trees, beginning to lurch slowly like elephants, in
the little wind that stirred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s a breeze,&rdquo; Garwood said. He
was still sniffing the night air like an animal.
&ldquo;Rain, too, in that air, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pusey tapped along on the old brick sidewalk
with his little stick and said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a cigar?&rdquo; said Garwood presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care if I do,&rdquo; said Pusey, throwing away
the one he was smoking. They paused, a match
scratched on a heel threw the ruddier lightning
of its own tiny flame upon their faces and then
their cigars glowed in the darkness, and left behind
them a fragrance that no other cigar in Pekin
could exhale, nor any perhaps, outside a certain
cigar store in Pennsylvania Avenue, where Garwood
owed a bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go toward the river, Pusey,&rdquo; said Garwood.
&ldquo;I fancy it&rsquo;ll be cooler there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care if I do,&rdquo; said Pusey.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The storm had come at last; the long heat was
broken. Overhead the thunder pealed up and
down its whole wide diapason, booming now and
then with new explosions, then rolling away in
awful melody into some distant quarter of the
broken heavens. The lightning crackled in long
streams of fire that zigzagged down the black sky,
reaching from heaven to earth, and in its after-glare
the clouds that flew so low showed their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>gray scud. The rain fell with a dead incessant
drumming on the earth, warm as new milk, and all
green things stirred rapturously as they drank
it in.</p>

<p>Down on the banks of the Illinois River Garwood
stood and looked on the dark waters. In the constant
play of the lightning he saw the trees on the
other shore bending their round heads to the wind;
he could see even their green leaves distinct in
the dazzling white light. He saw once some warm,
earthly gleam shining in some window he would
never know. He caught now and then the outline
of some house-boat, rude dwelling of the river-people,
stirring uneasily at its moorings. Once he
saw the wild sails of one of the wind mills erected
by the German settlers of that region, brought
with them, as it were, from their home far across
the seas, and once again in a glare more lasting
and vivid than any other, he saw a telegraph pole
lifting itself for an instant to his vision, spreading
its arms, and it reminded him of a cross on a
hill, some new Golgotha. He closed his eyes and
looked that way no more.</p>

<p>Behind him a crazy street that scrambled up
from the water&rsquo;s edge led back to the heart of the
town. The small houses showed cheerful lights,
now and then a laugh was borne to him from some
person humanly glad of the relief the rain had
brought. Then, in a fresh illumination, he saw
the court house where the fates were playing
with him. The storm raged, the lightning raced
in sheets of flame along the river, and though the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>winds lashed the rain up and down its bosom like
a broom, the drops fell so heavily that the surface
of the waters was smooth and placid as on a summer
afternoon, only dimpled with the infinite drops.
The congressman stood in the lush wet grass,
the water running off his broad hat in little rivulets,
but he soaked himself to the skin, and drank
in the rain, like all other life about him. He stood
there long, as though defying the storm. He folded
his arms in tragic attitudes. His thoughts
flashed here and there over his whole life, illuminating
for him scenes that stood vivid in memory
just as the lightning showed him the court
house, the trees across the river, the shanty boat,
the wind mill, the Golgotha of the telegraph pole.
He thought of his first convention, of the day he
waited in the Harkness drawing-room and saw old
Jasper working in the yard; of that election night
in Chicago, of his place in the House at Washington;
he thought of Rankin, of his mother, of
Emily, of his boy&mdash;ah, the boy!</p>

<p>The lightning glared. His eye caught the telegraph
pole again, he saw the cross, leaning at an
awful angle on the hill; he shuddered and pulled
down the brim of his hat and went away.</p>

<p>When he entered the hotel, the new life brought
by the rain was apparent in the new energy displayed
by the politicians. They had gathered indoors.
Garwood heard them joking, he heard
them laughing. There was industry everywhere.
The headquarters were full. In his own room, the
poker game was in progress. The chips clicked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>merrily. Even Rankin had succumbed and sat at
the table, a pile of the red and blue disks before
him. His coat and waistcoat and collar, even his
shoes, were off; his suspenders hung at his hips,
his great body was all relaxed. The windows were
open, the dirty curtains streamed on the wind that
blew in, and the floor was wet where the rain had
sprinkled it unrestrained. Rankin was laughing,
joying in the rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo; he said in his bass voice. And
he shook himself to relish the sensation of coolness
after all the week of insufferable heat.</p>

<p>The Singed Cat sat on a hard, rigid chair, his
coat still on, impervious as ever to the little discomforts
of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This game,&rdquo; he drawled, raising an eye to Garwood,
&ldquo;seems to be&mdash;for the purpose&mdash;of determining&mdash;whether&mdash;these
fellows&mdash;get my money&mdash;or
I get their&mdash;I O U&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the room rang loudly with the laughter.</p>

<p>Garwood stood, dripping with water, and looked
at them in wonderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heat spell&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; Rankin said presently.
&ldquo;Wisht the deadlock was. Maybe, though, the
rain &rsquo;ill fetch us luck. What d&rsquo;ye think, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood looked at him as if he did not know
what the man had said.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE storm ceased just before daybreak and
the light that slowly spread over the prairie
to the eastward suffused a new world. The
water dripped musically from the trees, the robins
sang, the frogs croaked comfortably along the wet
banks of the river, and the morning poured down
its green valley an air that sparkled like champagne.
The convention met again at nine o&rsquo;clock, but it
seemed another convention. The delegates arrived
early, and they, too, seemed to have been made
over like the world, for they entered, even the eldest
of them, with a new spring in their steps, and it was
to be noticed that they had been shaved and wore
clean linen.</p>

<p>The court room had been swept of all its litter,
and the floor was still damp with the fancy scrolls
the janitor had written with water from his sprinkling-can,
as if it had been some new kind of
fountain pen. The chairs were set in a fine amphitheater,
so orderly that the delegates sat down in
them carefully, as if, possessed by a new sense of
harmony, they feared to destroy the pleasing arrangement
of things. Even the cigars they puffed,
sending their white smoke gracefully up into the
lively air, had gained a fragrance. The delegates
had forgotten the animosities of the past few days,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>and they joked each other as they met again on
the old brotherly footing.</p>

<p>Rankin was there with an enormous fresh collar
lying down about his neck. He had left off
his waistcoat, and the white shirt his wife had
packed in his little traveling-bag when he started
from home was now at last donned in obedience to
her parting mandate, and unhidden as it was, gave
to the world a broad and convincing proof of his
domestic discipline. Randolph, too, was immaculate,
while young Knowlton was almost senatorial
in freshly brushed black clothes and linen that had
the metallic gloss of the laundry machine on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim,&rdquo; Randolph called across the room,
&ldquo;going to withdraw your candidate this morning,
ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to withdraw yourn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to withdrawing them all and
uniting on you? You&rsquo;d make a noble congressman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I would,&rdquo; Rankin responded, &ldquo;but I
couldn&rsquo;t afford to give the job all my time fer the
money the&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Randolph flung back at him,
&ldquo;but you might sublet it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I might git you a job shovelin&rsquo; wind off
the Capitol, only I reckon you wouldn&rsquo;t da&rsquo;st leave
that lucrative law practice o&rsquo; yourn, heh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The delegates around laughed at the old, old
jokes with which they chaffed each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to unitin&rsquo; on Grant here?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>That speech o&rsquo; his t&rsquo;other day &rsquo;uld tease the whole
surplus out o&rsquo; the treasury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knowlton blushed. Perhaps his heart swelled
for a second at the mere thought, for, like all
young lawyers, he had his ambitions, with the
dome of the Capitol at Washington in the perspective
of his dreams.</p>

<p>But the Singed Cat was leaning over the
judge&rsquo;s desk again and his little eyes, out of his thin
serious face, swept the circle of chairs before him.
His gavel fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention&mdash;will be&mdash;in order,&rdquo; he said in
his penetrating voice. And then he paused and
looked solemnly about. &ldquo;The chair&mdash;desires to remind&mdash;the
convention&mdash;&rdquo; he continued, and the
delegates looked up in alarm, &ldquo;that the administration&mdash;at
Washington&mdash;has redeemed&mdash;its promise&mdash;of
prosperity&mdash;to the farmer&mdash;by sending&mdash;the
former&mdash;and latter rain&mdash;upon the earth&mdash;in due
season, which shows&mdash;what the party&mdash;can do&mdash;in
the way&mdash;of keeping promises&mdash;when it gets&mdash;its
hand in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The convention laughed. Men were one with
all nature in being glad that morning. Then the
chairman continued gravely as before:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proceeding upon&mdash;the regular order&mdash;another
ballot&mdash;for nomination&mdash;of a representative&mdash;in
Congress&mdash;will be taken. Gentlemen&mdash;will prepare&mdash;their
ballots, and the secretary&mdash;will call&mdash;the
roll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Hale, for the twelve hundred and sixty-first
time, began his monotonous repetition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;DeWitt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sprague, eighteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chairmen long ago had ceased to poll their
delegations or to make the formal announcements
they had found so pleasant when they first began.
They had long been answering the roll-call in a
fixed perfunctory manner, as a bailiff opens court
by a formula that has grown meaningless, and will
know no change as long as institutions last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Logan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-four for Barrett.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Garwood, eighteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the delegates had strolled to the open
windows and stood leaning idly on the sills, looking
out on the wonderful morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moultrie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifteen, Sprague.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piatt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sprague, fifteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pusey arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he said in his weak voice.
Delegates near him looked up, Randolph crouched
like a lynx, then rose on bent knees, with an alert
inquiry in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On behalf of the delegation from Polk County,&rdquo;
Pusey continued, &ldquo;I cast the solid forty-five votes
for Jerome B. Garwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hale, leaning listlessly on an elbow, his head in
his hand, gazing away like an abstracted schoolboy
through the open windows as if the woods and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>fields beckoned him from irksome routine tasks,
had been calling the roll from memory, and keeping
no tally, for he knew the formula perfectly by
this time. But he looked up, startled. Rankin
tilted back in his chair, let it come down suddenly,
its legs striking the floor with a bang; his jaw
fell. Knowlton sprang to his feet, his face written
all over with surprise, and Randolph, his eyes
ablaze, quickly straightening his legs and raising
himself on his toes broke the startled stillness by
crying excitedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a scraping of chairs, a hum of voices,
that ascended immediately to a roar, and then a
score of men began to shout crazily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pusey had seated himself, he was as indifferent
as ever. And Rankin could only stare at him in
stupefaction.</p>

<p>The Singed Cat alone was unmoved by the
startling climax to all those withering days of heat
and suspense. He hammered the desk with his
gavel and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention&mdash;again&mdash;will be&mdash;in order. Let
the roll-call proceed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Hale called loudly amid the din that would
not subside:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tazewell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chairman of that delegation shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty votes for Garwood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The staid old court room with all its traditions
of the dignity of judicial proceedings was in an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>uproar. The whole convention was on its feet,
everybody was calling: &ldquo;Mr. Chairman.&rdquo; From
without, men to whom had been borne by some
occult transmission of intelligence the news of that,
the final moment, crowded breathlessly into the
room. The belief that the morning was cool had
been a delusion. Now that the peace induced by
universal harmony had been marred, men began
to perspire, to grow red in the face; the atmosphere
in an instant had become stifling. The Garwood
men had begun to cheer. The Sprague men
and perhaps the little group of Barrett&rsquo;s supporters,
foiled in whatever their original purpose had
been, realized that they were defeated, and they
raged impotently. Hale was hurriedly casting up
his easy sum, and when he handed the slip to Bailey
his heart leaped with the thought that at last the
Pekin post-office was his.</p>

<p>The Singed Cat deliberately studied his figures,
and his deliberation, with the power of the definite
announcement that was pending, compelled a sudden
quiet his gavel had theretofore been unable to
invoke. And at last, in the suspense which was
all fictitious, the product of the Anglo-Saxon mania
for legal forms, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon this ballot. General William M. Barrett&mdash;has
received&mdash;twenty-four votes,&rdquo; it was seen
that he was reversing the order for its effect, &ldquo;Conrad
Sprague&mdash;forty-eight, and Jerome B. Garwood&mdash;ninety-three.
Mr. Garwood&mdash;having received&mdash;the
necessary number&mdash;and a majority&mdash;of all&mdash;the
votes&mdash;cast&mdash;is therefore&mdash;declared&mdash;to be&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>nominee&mdash;of the convention&mdash;for Representative&mdash;in
Congress&mdash;for the Thirteenth District&mdash;of Illinois&mdash;for
the term&mdash;beginning&mdash;the fourth day&mdash;of
March&mdash;ensuing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The strain was over, the long pent-up emotions
of the seventy men who had stood solidly for Jerry
Garwood, and now had won victory at last, broke
forth, and they flung their hats into the air, tore
off their coats to wave aloft, brandished chairs, and
pounded one another on the back, yelling all the
time. The followers of Sprague yelled no less excitedly,
though their rage was that of defeat. Randolph
strode to where Hale was sitting, his mouth
stretched wide in a demented yell, and pounded
the table with his fist, crying unceasingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Singed Cat stood leaning as he had leaned
for days, with his eyes upon the desk he had
scarred with his gavel. For ten minutes, and it
seemed an hour, the men howled, until exhausted
by the exertion and the excitement, their voices
failed, and they collapsed into their chairs. But
Randolph, in the approximate order which the exhaustion
brought about, continued to cry, until at
last the Singed Cat&rsquo;s voice pierced to all the corners
of the court house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention&mdash;will be&mdash;in order! The convention&mdash;has
not&mdash;yet adjourned. There is&mdash;still&mdash;work&mdash;to
be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Randolph continued to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen&mdash;will resume&mdash;their seats,&rdquo; Bailey
said, &ldquo;before&mdash;they can&mdash;be recognized.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>Randolph hesitated, though still he cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bailey&rsquo;s eye forced him backward to his
place, and when he had retreated to the midst of
the Moultrie County delegation the chairman said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Moultrie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; Randolph said, and the convention,
supposing he was about to observe custom
and move to make the nomination unanimous,
listened. &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I challenge
the vote of the Polk County delegation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Moultrie&mdash;is out&mdash;of
order,&rdquo; the Singed Cat promptly ruled. &ldquo;None&mdash;but
a member&mdash;of the Polk County delegation&mdash;can
challenge&mdash;its vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sprague men seemed about to gather themselves
for another noisy protest, but interest had
suddenly veered to the Logan County delegation.
There a consultation was in progress, hurried and
eager, and out of it Knowlton arose, and his splendid
bass voice boomed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from Logan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I move you, sir, that the nomination
of Jerome B. Garwood be made unanimous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had seized the only little chance that remained
of identifying his delegation with the success
of the nominee. The band wagon had taken
them by surprise and rolled by too swiftly for them
to climb in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&mdash;from&mdash;Logan&mdash;moves&mdash;to make&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>nomination&mdash;of the Honorable&mdash;Jerome B.
Garwood&mdash;for candidate&mdash;for the office&mdash;of Representative&mdash;in
Congress&mdash;unanimous,&rdquo; said the
Singed Cat, yielding not a word of all his formula.
&ldquo;Those in favor&mdash;will say&mdash;&lsquo;Aye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The motion carried, of course, though not without
a great shout of &ldquo;Noes&rdquo; from the little band
of Sprague men, who had gathered about their
leader, looking defiance out of their defeat. The
Garwood men had wrung the moist hand of Pusey,
but it was Rankin whom they selected for the center
of their celebration. As they crowded about
him, they pommeled him, pulled him, screamed in
his ears; they would have liked to toss him to their
shoulders, but he was too big to be moved. He
could only sit in the midst of all their clamor, and
stare in wonder and amaze at Pusey. He, to
whom all the credit for the victory was ascribed
could not understand it, that was all. But presently
when he heard his name mentioned officially, he
stirred. Knowlton had moved that a committee
be appointed to wait on Garwood and inform him
of his nomination, and what Rankin heard was the
voice of Bailey saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the chair&mdash;appoints&mdash;as members&mdash;of the
committee&mdash;Messrs. Knowlton of Logan&mdash;Randolph
of Moultrie&mdash;and Rankin of Polk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The committee found their nominee in his room
at the hotel. He was sitting calmly by his open
window looking into the green boughs of the elm
trees that grew along that side of the old hostelry.
An open book lay on his knee, and having calmly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>called &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; in answer to the knock at the
door, he looked up as they entered, as if they had
interrupted the meditations of a statesman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, rising.</p>

<p>He laid his book aside and stepped softly toward
them. Rankin saw at once the change that
was on him. His hair was combed, his face
shaven, his long coat brushed, and he had donned
a fresh white waistcoat. As Rankin noted these
details, a pain pinched his heart, for he deduced
from them that there was no surprise in store for
Garwood. Ordinarily he would have been the first
to speak, he would have rushed forward, and seized
the hand of his candidate, and exulted in his frank
and open way, but now the words he had were
checked on his lips, and he remained dumb, growing
formal as the sensitive will. Thus it was left
for Knowlton, for Randolph had no stomach for
the job, to say, as he held forth his hand:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Garwood, let me be the first to congratulate
you on your nomination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood smiled, and took Knowlton&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I thank you,&rdquo; he said. He gave
his hand to Randolph, and last of all to Rankin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jim, old fellow,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>But he did not meet Rankin&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convention is waiting for you, Mr. Garwood,&rdquo;
said Knowlton, and the nominee answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed? I shall be glad to accompany
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The citizens at the door of the court room for
whom a representative in Congress had just been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>chosen, parted to let them pass, but they did not
cheer. They accepted their character of mere
spectators, and seemed to feel that they had no right
to disturb the proceedings by any demonstration
of their own. But the slight commotion they made
had its effect within, and the waiting delegates
turned their heads to catch a glimpse of their coming
congressman. He walked down the aisle on
the right arm of Knowlton; Randolph and Rankin
came marching behind. The Garwood men began
to clap their hands, they stamped their feet, and at
last they lifted up a shout, and so, marching erect
among them, his face white, his brows intent and
his fixed eyes brilliant with excitement, Garwood
walked the short way to the front. The Singed
Cat met him at the steps of the rostrum, and having
taken his hand, raised him to the judge&rsquo;s place,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen of the convention, I have the honor&mdash;to
present to you&mdash;your nominee&mdash;and next congressman&mdash;the
Honorable&mdash;Jerome B. Garwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bailey faded into the judge&rsquo;s chair, and Garwood,
slowly buttoning his coat, stood and looked over
the body of delegates. He began to bow. It was
Hale now who led the applause, not Rankin, and
he kept them at it by sheer force of the persistence
with which he clapped his own hands, not giving
in until he felt that the enthusiasm did justice to
the candidate, to his victory, and to the occasion.
The Sprague men sat silent, no sound came from
their quarter.</p>

<p>Garwood bowed in his stateliest way to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>Singed Cat as he said: &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; and he
bowed again to his audience as he added, &ldquo;and
gentlemen of the convention.&rdquo; And then he made
his speech.</p>

<p>He would not detain them long at that time, he
said, as if, at some future day, they might expect
to be held indefinitely. But he detained them long
enough to assure them how impossible it was for
him to find words in which to express his thanks
for the confidence they had reposed in him, and
his warm appreciation of the honor they had conferred
upon him. He referred to his past services
in their behalf, and in behalf of the party, and he
put the responsibility for his success upon them
by saying that future victories could only come
through their united efforts, as if he were making a
sacrifice for their sake in consenting to be their
candidate at all.</p>

<p>He spoke with the customary assumption that
his nomination had come entirely unsought, but
he made them feel his devotion by the willingness
with which he assured them he would bear their
banner that fall, and he graciously promised to give
his entire time from then until November to the
election of the whole ticket. Then in briefly reviewing
the services and the sacrifices of the late
Congress, he repeated, though with a fine extemporaneous
effect, the best sentences of his speech
at Washington, and quoted readily for them the
most impressive statistics of imports and exports,
which they did not at all understand, and as if these
figures had fully vindicated the wisdom of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>party&rsquo;s policy on the tariff question, he predicted
that the scepter of commercial empire was even
then passing into the hands of the United States.</p>

<p>He did not forget the old soldiers, nor their pensions,
neither did he neglect to pay most generous
tributes to the distinguished gentlemen whose
names had been mentioned in connection with the
high office to which he had been nominated. He
seemed almost to regret that they had not been
chosen in his place, such were their superior merits
and nobler virtues. And thus by an easy oratorical
circuit, he came around to where he had begun, and
thanking his fellow countrymen again, bowed and
smiled, and turned to receive the congratulatory
hand of the Singed Cat.</p>

<p>When the applause which Hale had loyally started
had ended, there were cries for Sprague, but as
Sprague was not there, an awkward pause was
prevented by a prompt change in the burden of the
cry, which now became a demand for Barrett.
From some immediate vantage point the general
was conjured forth, and made his speech, thanking
his friends, congratulating his opponents, and extolling
the party they unitedly represented, as if he
were as well satisfied with defeat as he would have
been with victory. He smiled complacently behind
his white beard, and he left the rostrum with his
dignity and respectability unimpaired.</p>

<p>And the convention was over.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ATURDAY evening Emily had a telegram
from Garwood announcing his nomination.
The message might have come to her Saturday
noon, but Garwood had found the delegates for
the most part in mood for celebration, while he himself
in the reaction of his spirit, was not disinclined
that way. He held a levee in his rooms reveling in
felicitations and when this was done, he suddenly
thought of the Sprague men, smarting under defeat.
They must not be allowed to depart for home nursing
their sores, and Garwood made it a point to see
them, or to have Rankin see them, and check in its
incipiency a contagion that might plague him in
the fall. So it was evening before he thought to
wire his wife, and it was late in the night before
he took the train for Lincoln, where he was to
change cars for home, leaving the little old German
town to settle to its normal quiet for Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>Emily, with the knowledge of politics that politicians&rsquo;
wives acquire, had watched from day to
day the development of the contest at Pekin. Jerome
had not written at all, but Emily chose to
consider his failure as an exercise of one of the
privileges of matrimony to which lovers look forward
as they labor over their love letters. But
she added a second reason which betrayed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>specious quality of the first, when she explained to
her father that in these days of newspapers, letter
writing had become a lost art, belonging to a
lavender scented past like the embroidery of tapestries.
She told her baby, as she rolled his round
little body in her lap, that she was jealous of politics,
and promised him that when the convention
was over, his father would be&mdash;and here she
gasped and dropped the pretense that the child
could understand. She could not bear to voice,
even to herself, the feeling that her husband was
any less the lover that he once had been. She realized
to the utmost his position, she had felt it
in little sacrifices she had been compelled to make,
and she knew of his utter dependence on relection.
Here, too, was another fact that she could
hardly face squarely and honestly. She clung to
her old ideal of her husband as a statesman no less
ardently than she clung to her old ideal of him as
a lover, and she disliked to feel that he was in
Congress merely as a means of livelihood. A
vague discontent floated nebulously within her,
but with all the adroitness of her mind she would
not allow it to concrete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he comes home!&rdquo; she cooed to the baby,
&ldquo;when he comes home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By Saturday, the strain upon her nerves had increased,
like all anxieties, in a ratio equal to the
square of the distance from its moving cause. All
day long she waited for news, hoping for the
best, but fortifying herself by trying to believe
that if the worst came, it might in the end be beneficial,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>because it must in time, at least, force them
to some more secure temporal foundation, where
they could not be disturbed by every whim of
politics. She remembered that Jerome had often
reminded her, though that was in moments of security
and elation, that all they that take the sword
shall perish with the sword. Her father himself
suffered a sympathetic suspense and in the afternoon
he journeyed down town to see if he could
learn anything of what was going on at Pekin.
Late in the day the <i>Citizen</i> hung out a bulletin
saying that Garwood had been nominated on the
twelve hundred and sixty-first ballot, and he hastened
home, with the importance of an idle old man,
longing to be the first to announce to Emily the
news. But she waved her telegram gaily at him
from the veranda as he hurried up the walk, and
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s won, father! He&rsquo;s won! He&rsquo;s just been
nominated!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man, cheated of a herald&rsquo;s distinction,
could not resist the impulse to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he was nominated this morning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt a pang at these tidings of her husband&rsquo;s
tardiness, but she put that away in the habit she
had acquired, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know&mdash;but these telegraph companies
are so slow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was happy all that evening, though she denied
that her own relief as to their position had
aught to do with that happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be much more useful this term than he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>was before,&rdquo; she told her father at supper. &ldquo;Jerome
always said, you know, that it took one term
for a congressman to learn the ropes at Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood reached home Sunday morning, and
when he saw Emily waiting in the doorway something
like pity for her smote him, and out of the
flush of his new success he yearned toward her, so
that, there in the old darkened hallway where the
tender scene had been enacted so many times in
other days, he folded her in his arms, and kissed
her lips and her brow and her hair, and called her
once more &ldquo;Sweetheart.&rdquo; And the happy little
woman purred in his embrace, and as she hid her
face against his breast, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Jerome&mdash;my big Jerome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it was all as it had been two years before.
Only now, lifting her eyes to his, her face reddened
with a blush as she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must come up and tell baby&mdash;he is dying
to hear all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily vowed to Garwood that now the convention
was over he must take a rest, and he was
content for days to loll at home. He slept late in
the morning and she bore his breakfast to him
with his mail, or he stretched himself on the divan
in the parlor in the afternoon while she read the
newspapers to him until he would sink into slumber
with the assurance that the room would be
darkened and the house hushed until he chose to
wake.</p>

<p>Pusey had nailed the party banner to his masthead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>as it were, and Emily read to Garwood with
a laugh that could not conceal her pride the big
types at the head of his editorial page:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Congress, Jerome B. Garwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There day after day it remained, and she read it
over and over, finding a certain joy in it. Pusey
had printed a long editorial announcing his determination
to support Garwood, and explaining with
the conviction of the editorial page&mdash;where the
argument is all one way, with no chance for rejoinder&mdash;his
own action in voting for the candidate he
had originally opposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t really consistent, is he, Jerome?&rdquo;
Emily said after she had read the editorial aloud
to her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he laughed, knocking the ashes from
the cigarette he was smoking, in a security he
could find nowhere else in Grand Prairie, for he
did not wish the town to know that he smoked
cigarettes, &ldquo;you know what Emerson says: &lsquo;A
foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,
adored by little statesmen and philosophers and
divines.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; the wife replied. &ldquo;We used
to read Emerson, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Her words breathed
regret. &ldquo;We never read any more. We seem to
have no time for anything but newspapers.&rdquo; And
she looked askance at the disordered pile of them
on the floor, and out of a sense of guilt reduced
them to smaller compass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how Mr. Rankin did it?&rdquo; she mused
a moment after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, induced Mr. Pusey to vote for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rankin?&rdquo; said Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. He did, didn&rsquo;t he? I thought he
did everything for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood sneered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rankin did nothing!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Rankin&rsquo;s what
the boys in Chicago call a selling plater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought he did everything!&rdquo; Emily repeated.
&ldquo;Who did then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I had as much as anybody to do
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I took him for a walk one night&mdash;the
night it stormed. Did it storm here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, fearfully; in the early morning&mdash;awfully!
But tell me&mdash;how did <i>you</i> do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just talked to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you persuade him&mdash;convince him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily was silent for a moment, and her brows
were knit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but checked herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
often thought,&rdquo; she said, beginning over, &ldquo;that we
ought to have Mr. Rankin and his poor little wife
here to dinner. I feel guilty about them. You&mdash;we&mdash;will
be good to them, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about Jim Rankin,&rdquo; he said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>&ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t know that I owe him much after
his letting the delegation here in Polk get away
from me. I had a hard time licking it back into
line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was several days after that Cowley published
an article in the Chicago <i>Courier</i> which told of the
tremendous promises that had been made at Pekin
in exchange for votes. He said that Garwood had
shown himself a clever politician, for he had not
only been able to hold up most of the appointments
in his district until after his second nomination,
but he had had the help of the administration&rsquo;s
influence at Pekin. Cowley then proceeded
to schedule the distribution of patronage that
would be made; Hale for the post-office at Pekin,
Bailey for Speaker of the House, and Rankin, of
course, for the post-office at Grand Prairie. He
could not dispose of Pusey as definitely, but it was
not to be supposed that Pusey had gone to Garwood
and saved him from political oblivion for
nothing at all.</p>

<p>Emily read the article aloud to Jerome. He
knew by her silence when she had finished that
questions were forming in her mind. She set her
lips and began shaking her head, until she produced
a low &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That New England conscience of yours troubling
you again?&rdquo; asked Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we had more New England conscience
in our politics!&rdquo; she replied with a wife&rsquo;s severity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got enough of New England in our politics
now!&rdquo; Garwood said, with a flare of the western
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>animosity to New England&rsquo;s long domination
of public affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she persisted, and he saw that her lips
were growing rigid, &ldquo;I think we need conscience
in our politics, whether it&rsquo;s New England or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood laughed, but it was a bitter laugh.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t win. A conscience, Emily,
is about as great an impediment to a practical politician
in these days as it is to a successful lawyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cynical, Jerome,&rdquo; she pleaded. And
she thought again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you promise Hale the post-office for getting
you those Tazewell County votes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; said Garwood, &ldquo;what of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; said Emily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you have me do? Give it to some
fellow over there who was against me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-n-n-no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You liked it when I
told you I was going to&mdash;take care of Rankin,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a woman&rsquo;s logic!&rdquo; he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in buying votes, do you, Jerome?&rdquo;
she asked, with her lips still tense so that
they showed a little line of white at the edges of
their red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you do believe in buying them with offices.
What&rsquo;s the post-office at Pekin worth?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, eighteen hundred, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighteen hundred&mdash;for four years; let&rsquo;s see&mdash;four
eights&mdash;thirty-two; hum-m-m, four ones&mdash;three&mdash;seven;
seven&mdash;thousand, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not very good at figures, but
you&rsquo;ve nearly hit it&mdash;within two hundred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never could multiply in my mind,&rdquo; Emily confessed.
&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t think it right to give
a man seven thousand dollars in money for a delegation
from the county, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Garwood answered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s too high.
You&rsquo;re getting into senatorial figures now.&rdquo; He
laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do be serious, Jerome. I don&rsquo;t see the difference
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, a woman couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;women never could
understand politics, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I understand this&mdash;that I have learned a
good deal about politics, and my ideas have been
changed. I used to think that in this country the
people arose and elected their best man to represent
them, but it seems that the representative
elects himself, and then the people&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the people out here elected
their best man when I went in?&rdquo; Garwood asked,
with an honest laugh in his eyes.</p>

<p>She bent over impulsively and kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m speaking generally
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; Garwood insisted, &ldquo;women
can&rsquo;t speak generally. It&rsquo;s always a personal, concrete
question with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, Jerome, I&rsquo;ve had my ideals&mdash;in
politics, too, since you interested me in politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t interested in politics, you were interested
in one politician, and that politician was&mdash;me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&mdash;you were my ideal, and I thought
of you as I thought of Patrick Henry, in the old
Virginia House of Burgesses, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you haven&rsquo;t thought deeply enough, my
dear. Patrick had his own troubles, believe me,
though they didn&rsquo;t get into history. Did you ever
stop to inquire how Patrick got to the House of
Burgesses? It was easy enough to make speeches
after he was there&mdash;that was the easiest part of it&mdash;but
the getting there, it wasn&rsquo;t all plain sailing
then. First he had the devil&rsquo;s own time getting
on the delegation himself, then after he&rsquo;d made
himself solid, by supporting other men awhile, he
had another time rounding up delegations that
would support <i>him</i>, and there was many a man in
Virginia that day, whose name is lost in darkness,
who was ag&rsquo;in him, and many another who went
out and saw the boys and set up the pins and got
the right ones on the delegation, who was thinking
of some fat job in that same House of Burgesses.
And take any other of the white statuesque
figures of those heroic times&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Jerome, don&rsquo;t&mdash;you&rsquo;re too much of an
iconoclast. Leave me my ideals. There&rsquo;s the
baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She arose at the premonitory whimper that a
mother&rsquo;s ear detected.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ANKIN returned to Grand Prairie, from the
convention, in a state of mental numbness.
The thing he had gone to Pekin to do had
been done, and yet he did not know how it had been
done. Every one greeted him as the author of Garwood&rsquo;s
fortunes; his latest with the rest, and he was
forced to accept congratulations to which he did not
feel himself entitled. As the days went by and he
saw Garwood&rsquo;s name at the head of Pusey&rsquo;s editorial
column, and read Pusey&rsquo;s articles favoring
Garwood&rsquo;s election, he was more than ever at a loss
to account for the anomalous situation in which he
found himself. Sometimes he had his doubts, for he
was old enough in political ways to have acquired
the politician&rsquo;s distrust, and what with the whisperings
of friends and the articles he had read in other
newspapers he suffered a torment of suspicions
which were the more agonizing because of the
wrong he subconsciously felt they did Garwood.
At last he went to him.</p>

<p>With the small energy the morning could revive
in him, Rankin mounted the stairs to Garwood&rsquo;s
office. Garwood was opening a congressman&rsquo;s
mail, always large, and he looked up from
his pile of letters and greeted Rankin with a&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>Rankin, as he sat down, was sensible of the
change that had come over their relations, and he
grieved for the old days when he had been able to
enter this office with so much more assurance. But
he was not the man to dally long in sentimentalities,
and he said, when he had settled into the chair
and mopped his brow:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerry, I&rsquo;ve come to have it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood unfolded the letter he had just taken
from its envelope. His face reddened as he bent
over to read it, and he did not turn around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have what out, Jim?&rdquo; he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Rankin went on, &ldquo;this misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What misunderstanding? I don&rsquo;t know what
you mean. Explain yourself.&rdquo; Garwood kept on
tearing open his letters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Rankin continued, &ldquo;you know it
hain&rsquo;t all like it used to be, that&rsquo;s all. I don&rsquo;t
know how to say it&mdash;I just feel it, but it&rsquo;s there,
an&rsquo;, damn it, I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin paused, and then when Garwood did
not reply, he went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause o&rsquo; my fallin&rsquo; down in the
county convention here &rsquo;t home, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all right;
I don&rsquo;t blame you fer feelin&rsquo; sore. Course, it come
out all right over at Pekin&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how it
was done, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know as I want to know&mdash;I
know I didn&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo; to do &rsquo;ith it, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t
claim none o&rsquo; the credit, ner want it. I &rsquo;as glad
you won out, glad as you was. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; give my right
arm clean up to the shoulder to&rsquo;ve brought it &rsquo;bout
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>fer you myself. I didn&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;, I know. I
felt kind o&rsquo; paralyzed all the time over there, after
losin&rsquo; the delegation here, an&rsquo; I seemed to myself
jus&rsquo; to be standin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; like any other dub that
&rsquo;as on the outside. I didn&rsquo;t feel <i>in</i> it, somehow,
an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t feel in it now, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter.
I&rsquo;ve al&rsquo;ays been with you, Jerry, an&rsquo; you know it,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m with you now, but they&rsquo;re tellin&rsquo; strange
stories &rsquo;roun&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t like &rsquo;em, an&rsquo;&mdash;I jus&rsquo; want
to know where I stand &rsquo;ith you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood wheeled about in his swivel chair. He
looked at Rankin a moment and then he smiled.
And when he had smiled, he leaned comfortably
back in his chair and placed the tips of his fingers
together over his white waistcoat, and then he
spoke at last, in his softest voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jim, that worries you&mdash;the post-office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jerry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t so much that. I
want it, o&rsquo; course, you know how I need it, an&rsquo; I
want it more&rsquo;n ever jus&rsquo; now, but I ain&rsquo;t worried so
much about that. I&rsquo;ve got your word, an&rsquo; I know
you never went back on it yet, to a friend, though
you know, Jerry, that if it &rsquo;uld help you any, you
could have your promise back, an&rsquo; give the post-office
where it &rsquo;uld do the mos&rsquo; good. You know
all you&rsquo;d have to do &rsquo;uld be to say the word, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood smiled again and leaned forward in his
chair and laid one of his white hands on Rankin&rsquo;s
fat knee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been giving
yourself a great deal of unnecessary trouble. You
know me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sure,&rdquo; assented Rankin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you ought to,&rdquo; added Garwood, still smiling
blandly, and a slight reproach was in his tone.
&ldquo;You should have known, Jim, that I realized you
had done all in your power. I never for an instant
blamed you; believe me when I say that. It only
occurred to me that I could handle the little affair
over at Pekin better than you could. I knew that
you could never come at Pusey; I knew that you
two never could agree in a thousand years, so I
just took hold of it myself&mdash;not with very much
hope, I confess, but I thought it worth trying.
And luckily it came about all right in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s all right, Jerry,&rdquo; Rankin protested,
waving his hand assuringly toward Garwood.
&ldquo;I only wanted to know that you felt all
right about it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; His great red face smiled
on Garwood like a forgiven boy&rsquo;s. But suddenly
it hardened again into the face of a man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were right&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; done nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;ith
Pusey, damn him. My way&rsquo;s different from yourn.
Maybe yourn&rsquo;s right. You believe in conciliatin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em; I believe in killin&rsquo; &rsquo;em off. An&rsquo; your way won,
that&rsquo;s all. What &rsquo;id you have to promise him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood was leaning back again, and had
pressed the tips of his fingers together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said, beginning slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a
good deal about politics. I learned a good deal
from you, and I picked up a good deal down at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>Washington during the session, and the chief thing
I&rsquo;ve learned is to go slow on promises. I told him,
of course, that I&rsquo;d take care of him. I told him
that there was no use in our being enemies, none
whatever; that we could just as well work together
for the party&rsquo;s good, and accomplish more
that way than by keeping up a bitter factional war
here in the county, because the first thing we knew
we&rsquo;d wake up some cold morning in November to
find that the other fellows were all in and we were
all out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin&rsquo;s gaze was fixed afar. His brows had
knitted themselves into a scowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had to tell him that, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did tell him that, yes. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t jus&rsquo; like this thing o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; thick
&rsquo;ith him, so sudden, that&rsquo;s all. Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to run
the campaign fer you this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, who would run it but you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Rankin, smiling again all over. &ldquo;You
want me? An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s Pusey goin&rsquo; to have to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll let him print editorials,&rdquo; laughed Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Rankin, &ldquo;jus&rsquo; so&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t
have to see him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood scrutinized Rankin closely an instant,
and once more he leaned over in his persuasive
way and laid his hand on Rankin&rsquo;s knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Jim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you and
Pusey to be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin shrank from the thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must&mdash;now listen to me&mdash;I demand it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>I want no mistakes made. I want you all to work
harmoniously this fall, and a little ill-feeling right
here in our camp may beat us. We&rsquo;ve got a fight
on our hands; I&rsquo;m half afraid of those Sprague fellows.
They&rsquo;ll have their knives out, and we&rsquo;ve
got to hold together; above all we&rsquo;ve got to keep
Pusey in line, for the Sprague fellows here don&rsquo;t
feel any too good about his having come over to
me, and Pusey has a following. More than that,
he&rsquo;s got a newspaper, and he can make it tell.
We&rsquo;ve got to keep in with him, and I want you to
patch up a truce with him. You must, do you
hear?&rdquo; Garwood gave Rankin&rsquo;s knee a shake. &ldquo;Do
you hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you say so, Jerry,&rdquo; he consented presently,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;ll have to be. Whatever you say goes, o&rsquo;
course, but the truce&rsquo;ll be a damned sight more
out&rsquo;ard than in&rsquo;ard &rsquo;ith me, I tell you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t feel that way, Jim; you
mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my God, Jerry!&rdquo; Rankin exclaimed, &ldquo;it
&rsquo;as fer your sake that I got to hatin&rsquo; him like I
do, though I never did like the little whelp. Gosh!
It did gall me to have to sit in a convention beside
him an&rsquo; hear him announce the vote fer Polk
County! I never thought I&rsquo;d live to see the day
when little Free Pusey could get on a Polk delegation,
I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he shook his head as one who bewails the
evil times on which he has fallen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, for my sake, then, make up with him. I
don&rsquo;t cherish any ill-will towards him, Jim.&rdquo; Garwood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>said this with a swelling air of magnanimity
as if he had attained to heights of charity known
only to the early Christian martyrs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never was a good hater, Jerry,&rdquo; said Rankin,
as though it were a virtue to be as consistent
and steadfast in hatreds as in friendships.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE August sun was ripening the corn, and
in some of the more fertile fields the slender
stalks already nodded their young plumes
in the mid-summer heat that quivered over the
prairies. It was too much to expect of politicians
that they work in such weather, and they were
loath to begin the campaign, yet it was necessary
to make the first lazy preparations for the heavy
work that would be upon them when the frost
should begin to hint of coming fall.</p>

<p>Garwood was understood to be resting at home,
and it was rumored that he would go away for a
while and recuperate in the East, where, as it appears
to men in the West, there is rest for the
weary. He had in reality the natural reluctance
to beginning a long contemplated and difficult task
that the lesser politicians felt, though he had so
much more at stake than they. Yet he would not
have liked the boys to be as apathetic as he, and
in a dim recognition of this fact he bestirred himself
one day and went down to see Pusey. Thereupon
Pusey began to write in his paper of the
dangers of apathy and over-confidence, rallying the
party by sternly telling it that the mere fact of its
dominance in the Thirteenth District did not justify
its lay members in staying at home and trusting to
others to pull it through. This effort satisfied Garwood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>for a time, and he loafed on through August
and then said to Rankin:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wait till the middle of September, and then
give them six weeks of a rattling fire all along the
line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rankin, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to tap our
enthusi&rsquo;sm too soon, an&rsquo; have it give out on us the
way ol&rsquo; Bromley&rsquo;s bar&rsquo;l did. Gosh! Didn&rsquo;t he
freeze up them last two weeks, though!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They laughed at the pleasing memories of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damned if I didn&rsquo;t like that campaign,&rdquo; Rankin
went on. &ldquo;Never enjoyed one more&rsquo;n my life,
though I&rsquo;ve had some hot ones in my time. That
story, now, that Pusey printed &rsquo;bout you&mdash;&rsquo;member
how skeered we was? An&rsquo; you &rsquo;member them
things o&rsquo; Bromley&rsquo;s&mdash;what was they?&mdash;kind o&rsquo; night
shirts, now&mdash;heh?&mdash;oh, yes! Well, sir, you&rsquo;d ought
to heerd the kids I&rsquo;d planted in the gallery that
night when Bromley come on to the stage.&rdquo; And
Rankin reared back, and roared and slapped his
thigh. &ldquo;By the way, what&rsquo;s come o&rsquo; Bromley?
I never hear o&rsquo; him any more, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Garwood, with his large air of
a knowledge of affairs, and then, too, with the
pride of a man who doesn&rsquo;t wish his opponent belittled,
especially after he has defeated that opponent.
&ldquo;I hear of him frequently. He&rsquo;s general counsel
for his road now, and lives in Chicago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, believe I did hear somethin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that,&rdquo;
said Rankin, nodding his head. &ldquo;He went up there
same&rsquo;s all the rest o&rsquo; the judges from the country
does. They get elected to the County Court down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>here, which gives them the title o&rsquo; judge, then
when they come off, an&rsquo; have to go to work again,
they go up to Chicago an&rsquo; practise on the title.
After they&rsquo;ve been there &rsquo;bout two years people
begin to b&rsquo;lieve they &rsquo;as judges o&rsquo; the <i>Supreme</i>
Court.&rdquo; Rankin paused in his philosophizing, and
then resumed, quite seriously: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know but
what Bromley give you a better run at that than
this here young Wetherby &rsquo;ill do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve seen him onct or twict over&rsquo;t Sullivan.
He&rsquo;s just a young lawyer, an&rsquo; he knows &rsquo;at
if the&rsquo; &rsquo;as any chanct o&rsquo; his winnin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d never been
nominated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>September came, but the weather remained as
hot as ever. Rankin declared that the mere prospect
of cool weather held out by the almanac made
him feel better, though he believed that the almanac
ought to be revised, for he was certain the seasons
were changing in Illinois. As a boy he had always
gone skating on Thanksgiving, he said, but now
the cold weather never came until after New Year&rsquo;s.
And he remembered, too, that the girls always
wore white dresses and gave a May-pole dance
on the first day of May. &ldquo;But nowadays,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll have to hop roun&rsquo; in Galway overcoats
if they wanted to celebrate that day, an&rsquo; as
fer summer&mdash;well, it keeps hotter&rsquo;n the hinges o&rsquo; hell
right up to November, But politics is politics,
an&rsquo; I must be gettin&rsquo; a move on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin roused at last, and called a meeting of
the congressional committee. The members, newly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>chosen at the Pekin convention, came to Grand
Prairie and met in the office of the county treasurer,
and there, under the blazing gas jets and
with the blinds closed, they began to organize Garwood&rsquo;s
campaign.</p>

<p>Rankin and Pusey had long ago shaken hands,
Garwood standing by with the beatific glow of the
peacemaker, though all the while the look in Rankin&rsquo;s
eyes was hard as ever, and Pusey&rsquo;s smirk was
unchanged. Pusey attended the meeting of the
congressional committee, even if he was not a
member, and the others were pleasantly stimulated
by the prospect of a disagreement between him and
Rankin. But the editor maintained a perfect silence
the whole evening, never vouchsafing one suggestion,
but acquiescing in all that was done, if not by
voting, which would have been impertinent, at least
by respectfully nodding his head.</p>

<p>And if, later, when the county central committee,
of which Pusey was now the chairman, met,
Rankin did not return his call, as it were, by reciprocally
attending the meeting, he at least found
business that took him out of town, over to Mason
County, and thereby deprived the alert editor of
the <i>Advertiser</i> of the ground work of a story that
would have served him for every dull hour of an
unusually dull campaign. It was perhaps well for
Garwood, considering the strained relations between
his two chief supporters, that this was a dull
campaign. He found it much less trying than
the first. There was not so much for him to do,
and what there was he could enjoy in a more leisurely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>manner. It was the off year, in which the
people, unable to work themselves up to the pitch
of excitement required of them in presidential
years, leave politics to the politicians even more
than they ordinarily do. The stripling from Moultrie
County who was running against Garwood
seemed far beneath his notice, except when he
chose in his speeches to patronize him. His own
acquaintance had grown wider, there were many to
welcome him everywhere he went, and they liked the
distinction of knowing their congressman and of
calling him &ldquo;Jerry.&rdquo; Garwood loved to bask in their
smiles, to revel in the sensation of personal popularity,
and it became more and more easy to convince
himself that he was a genuine man of the people.
There was another new feature in this campaign
that he enjoyed. He was enabled in his speeches
to speak familiarly of Washington, of things that
were done and said in the House, and to relate personal
anecdotes of noted men, to whom it was apparent
he could talk in a free colloquial way, that
were almost as delightful to his auditors as to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose, now that it is all over,&rdquo; he would say,
&ldquo;that I betray no confidence in telling you that one
afternoon when I had gone over to the White House
and was waiting there in the ante-chamber to see
our great president, that he spied me among the
others&mdash;Senator Ames was there with me&mdash;and,
coming over to where we stood, said: &lsquo;Jerry, you&rsquo;re
just the fellow I wanted to see&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not necessary that year for him to defend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>his own record. He could submerge his political
individuality into that of the responsible administration
and make his speeches, like all the other
speeches delivered that fall, or any fall, by men
striving to retain seats in Congress, mere efforts
to explain why Congress had not done what the
platform of two years before promised it would do.</p>

<p>As a congressman, too, he could enjoy the importance
of giving his time to the state committee,
and of delivering speeches in other districts
in Illinois, and once he even went beyond the borders
of his own state, and journeyed over into
Ohio, where he spoke in the Dayton District for
his friend Whiteside, who sat beside him in the
House. This experience he relished more than
all the others, for the Dayton people, not sure of
his exact position among public men, determined
to make no mistake, and so accorded him all the
honors a prophet may expect away from his own
country.</p>

<p>On election night he found that he had been
relected, though the returns from Moultrie County
showed a falling off in his majority, as did those
from his own county. But then, as Rankin said
in congratulating Emily, after they had sat up
until midnight in Harkness&rsquo;s parlors receiving the
returns:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A reduced majority draws the salary just as
well as any.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-XIX">XIX</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ARWOOD led the way through the smoke
and clangor of the B. &amp; O. station, followed
by his little family, Emily hurrying anxiously
along, holding her skirts in one hand, her bag and
umbrella in the other, and the nurse bearing the
sleeping John Ethan in the rear. A fog was rolling
up from the Potomac and settling thick over the city.
The air, heavy as it was, was grateful to Emily, after
her long night&rsquo;s nausea from the sickening curves,
and she was glad that it was moist, for the dampness
bathed her face and cooled her brow. Like all
comers to Washington, she had no sooner set her
foot to the pavement than she lifted her eyes to
behold the Capitol, which symbols the might and
majesty of the Republic to the stranger, who, when
he once beholds it, ceases to be a stranger, and
feels at home, for this city belongs to the nation
and each citizen in it has an immediate revelation
of his citizenship and of his common ownership in
the things that make it interesting and great. Emily
remembered the Capitol as she had seen it first, on
the most memorable morning of their wedding
trip, lifting its dome into the blue of an autumn
sky, and in the gladness of those nuptial days, she
had pleased her own fancy and delighted Jerome
by fashioning an analogy between its coved apex
and the life they were destined to lead under its
shadow&mdash;rounded, symmetrical and complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span></p>

<p>But on this December morning, the fog obscured
the Capitol, and though Emily&rsquo;s eye ranged
everywhere, she could not find it. Jerome had
nodded to one of the hackmen who thrust their
whips at him in menacing invitation, and as he
turned to assist Emily, he knew what she was looking
for. So with the pleased superiority of one
who has grown familiar with noted sights, Garwood
pierced the gloom, and then, like a sailor
sighting land, he pointed and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There; there it is. See it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His little wife bent her head and her brows,
while the cabman waited with a sneer, and at last
she smiled and sighed an &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; of recognition.
For she had descried the massive dome, floating
majestically in the gray mists as if it had detached
itself from its base and had become a ghost of the
fog, of a color and of an immensity with it. As
she tried to trace its vague colossal proportions,
it seemed to mount higher and higher on the heavy
clouds, and there it hung and brooded over the
capital of the nation, over the nation itself, and
over its destiny. It soared far above the passions
and partisanship of the little men who swarmed
through its great porticos and in its huge rotunda,
and it lifted her soul to lofty conceptions,
so that she forgot all else and stood there with
her foot on the step of the carriage, while the
others, the misanthropic coachman, the hungry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>and accustomed husband, the heavy-eyed nurse,
and the slumbering babe, waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Garwood at last, and she caught
her breath and recalled herself to the earth with a
sigh.</p>

<p>As they rolled over the asphalt streets, she
pressed her face to the rattling panes of the carriage
window, but she could find the great dome
no more; it had floated away and vanished like a
vision out of sight.</p>

<p>Emily saw the Capitol at other times. She saw
it close at hand, on her way with Garwood across
the park that spread its plots between the Capitol
and the rising walls of the new congressional
library, as she paused to rest a moment near the
statue of Washington boxed up for the winter, and
looked up, up, up the pillared front of the building
to the dome shining in the afternoon sun. She
saw it on dark nights, when its rows of little windows
blinked out of the black wall of night; she
saw it rising calm, pale and majestic in the luminous
light of the moon; but it was not in any of
these moods that she could remember it thereafter,
nor as she had seen it for the first time on
her wedding journey, but forevermore it appeared
as she had seen it that morning, when her eyes
pierced through the mists and caught that one
glimpse of its mighty image, a gray specter of the
life she once had pictured to herself.</p>

<p>They drove to the hotel where Garwood had
lived during his first session, and where he still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>owed a bill, and took the rooms he had arranged
for.</p>

<p>In the flush of his relection he had insisted
upon his wife&rsquo;s going to Washington with him for
the short session, and without much difficulty she
had induced her father to consent to her departure.
He had said he could get along without her
during the three months the session would last,
though the lengthened tone in which he drawled
out the names of the three months, December,
January and February, told of a prospect before
him as long and dark as the winter itself. She had
silenced the qualms she had felt by wringing from
him half a promise to come on to Washington himself
in February; he might, she insisted, anticipate
the spring that way. And when her duty to her
father seemed drawing her away from her resolution,
she dwelt inwardly on her duty to her husband.
She had thought through the long hours
of wakeful nights of her separations from him; she
had counted with a gasp of sudden fright the days
into which those separations lengthened, and she
had resolved that nevermore in the future would
she let him be so long away without her. She had
buttressed her soul in that regard on certain sage
words of her Mother Garwood, who had shaken her
head and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t good, it ain&rsquo;t good, Em&rsquo;ly, fer young
husban&rsquo;s to be away too much from their wives.
It never was intended; no, it never was intended,&rdquo;
she repeated, shaking her head with the satisfaction
she found in her knowledge of the will of God in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>His personal dealings with His creatures on this
earth, and her words had impressed Emily as if
they were indeed a revelation.</p>

<p>During their first few days in Washington, it
rained continually, and she stayed indoors, save
for a trip down the street as far as the Treasury
building, around which she walked in a little spirit
of adventure, taking her eyes from its portico long
enough to gaze down the wide sweep of Pennsylvania
Avenue, with the Capitol rising at its end.
And then she hurried back to the baby.</p>

<p>Garwood was too much occupied with what he
called duties connected with the opening of Congress
to be much with her. On the day the Congress
convened he took her with him and left her
in the gallery to look down on the assembling
members, and she found her keenest interest in
following him about as he moved to his seat, and
in watching the members pause to shake his hand
and to smile, and to join their laugh with his, so
that she knew they were congratulating each other
upon relection.</p>

<p>Garwood otherwise was most of the time out of
her sight. She had observed in him a new interest
in life the moment his feet touched the stones of
Washington. He went about with a quick, elastic
step, he was full of enthusiasm and laughter, and
if he kept her waiting for him long at meal time,
he returned to her with ample apologies and in a
state of excitement that made him solicitously
merry during the meal. At dinner he usually called
for a bottle of wine, and, as his eyes fastened themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>upon the glass into which the wine bubbled
as the negro tilted the bottle he had bound in a
napkin, he said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! This is life once more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as she looked at him inquiringly, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s worth all a fellow has to go
through out in that beastly mud hole to be back
here where one can really live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in one of these moods that he consented
to make the trip over to Arlington, and Emily,
who had already matured a feminine plot of reviving,
thereby, some of the emotions of their wedding
journey, felt a new resilience in her spirits that
verified at last all the hopes she had held out to
her heart for this sojourn in the Capital with her
husband.</p>

<p>It was a warm afternoon, and the sun shone
down with a cruel suggestion of spring&mdash;cruel,
because one must instantly remember that it was
only December, and that the winter lay all before.
They took their luncheon that day in the Senate
restaurant and Emily assured Jerome that she
had never enjoyed any luncheon so much in her
life. She was tempted in the spirit of holiday that
was upon them, to drink some of the wine Jerome
said they must have to make the repast perfect,
but her conscience, or her sense of responsibility
as the keeper of Jerome&rsquo;s conscience, would not
let her. As they sat there over their oysters, Emily
was happier than she had been for months, and she
looked proudly across the table at Jerome and
compared him to the distinguished men he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>constantly pointing out&mdash;senators with whose
names she had long been familiar, whose faces she
had so often seen in the newspapers. There was a
species of reassurance in her immediate observation
that they were, after all, very human men,
who, despite the partisan bitterness they could not
conceal behind the euphemisms senatorial courtesy
moved them to employ in their contributions
to the <i>Congressional Record</i>, nevertheless foregathered
companionably, Republicans and Democrats,
and even Populists, and joked and laughed
like common brotherly men. The little bell that
was always jingling them away to roll-calls up in
the Senate chamber, snatching them, as it were,
from their lobsters and salads, or, in the cases of
the older and hence more dyspeptic statesmen,
their bread and milk, just as they were being
served, filled that little room in the basement with a
fine excitement, which reflected its warmth in her
glowing cheeks, and sent its exhilaration coursing
through her veins as happily as if she had consented
to drink the wine Jerome still urged upon
her.</p>

<p>As she looked at all those great men, and looked
at Jerome, thinking how much more handsome he
was than they, she projected her thought to the
time when he would be a senator from Illinois and
they would appear together in the Senate restaurant,
in their turn to be pointed out. The pleasing
sense of distinction was already with her, because
of the company they were in, though Emily had
speedily learned that most congressmen in Washington
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>go about unnoticed, and that not all of the
senators are known by sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until the cartoonists take them up,&rdquo; Jerome
had explained to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go splendidly in a cartoon!&rdquo; she said,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would I?&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s hardly a
compliment. You know, the cartoons are all hateful,
outrageously hateful&mdash;at least, the good ones.
Those that praise are always absurd and flat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they were finishing their luncheon, three men
came in and took a table across the room. When
Garwood saw them he bowed, and some signal evidently
passed between them, for Garwood excused
himself for an instant from his wife, and went over
to join them, leaning over their table to whisper
for a moment. When he came back he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Em, I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, but I find I shall be
detained here at the Capitol for about half an hour.
We have a meeting of a subcommittee I&rsquo;m on.
I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; he added as he saw her face
fall, &ldquo;but if you can go back to the hotel&mdash;I&rsquo;ll put
you on the car&mdash;I&rsquo;ll join you there at two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led her down the hall past the Senate post-office,
then out to New Jersey Avenue, where he
put her on the car that took her back to the lonesome
little hotel.</p>

<p>It was long past midnight when he rejoined her
there.</p>

rain slanted dismally into the street below.
Jerome lay in bed sleeping still, though it
was now nearly noon. He slept hard after his labors
on the subcommittee, and she had sent the nurse with
the baby to patrol the long hallway, in order that the
child might not awaken his father, and she had gone
about herself noiselessly, to the same end. She had
tried to read, but could not. She had fancied a long
letter to Dade Emerson, describing her Washington
trip, but the enthusiasm she had imagined for
this letter, the first in a long while in which she
had anything to relate that would compare with
the letters Dade was able to write, colored as they
were with the picturesqueness of Old World travel,
could not that morning ring true.</p>

<p>She had thought the day before, when they were
in such gala mood, that the old lover-like intimacy
was growing upon them again, and she had told
herself that a winter thus together in Washington
would once more intertwine their lives into one harmonious
and beautiful fabric; that all their dreams
would come true. She had carefully scanned all the
senators and public men she had seen, intent upon
knowing them, at least by sight, and she had resolved,
too, that she would study the details of public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>questions more deeply that she might be of real
help to her husband, as he grew in statecraft.</p>

<p>But&mdash;she had felt her heart turn cold and dead
within her as she recognized, in her curiously intricate
train of morbid thought that these very resolves
proved the existence of conditions she had
refused to acknowledge, and now she sat before
the window, her little chin on her hand, looking
vacantly out. Over the way a Catholic church,
built of stone, held one of its oaken doors ajar.
She saw a woman, evidently a poor woman, for she
wore a shawl over her head, enter the church.
Somehow the sight added to her despondency.</p>

<p>She was roused by a knock on the door. A bell-boy
stood there with a tray. She took the cards,
and read the names of Joseph Hale, and Freeman
H. Pusey. Hale had written his name upon the
blank card supplied by the hotel; Pusey&rsquo;s was a
sample of his own job work and proclaimed him as
editor and proprietor of the Grand Prairie <i>Citizen</i>,
Daily and Weekly. She thrilled a little at the
thought that she was in the presence of the reality
of a delegation of constituents calling upon their
congressman; and then a great flood of homesickness
rolled over her, a homesickness that was the
more acute because these men were not known to
her, and could only suggest home, not realize it
for her here so far away from that home.</p>

<p>She told the boy to show the gentlemen to the
parlor, and to say that Mr. Garwood would be
down presently.</p>

<p>When she awakened her husband, as she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>thought the importance of the visit justified her in
doing, he roused and writhed his big arms over his
curly head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; he yawned.</p>

<p>She read the names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let &rsquo;em wait,&rdquo; he said, then he rolled heavily
over, stretched, and went to sleep again. She went
down to the parlor herself to meet the two men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mrs. Garwood,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad to
see any one from home. Mr. Garwood was detained
very late last night by an important committee
meeting and is still sleeping. Can you come back
later, or will you wait? I do not like to rouse him
just now&mdash;he is quite worn out,&rdquo; she added, selecting
for them the alternative she preferred. They
adopted her selection and said they could come back
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can go out and see the town a little,&rdquo; said
Hale. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been in Washington before,
ma&rsquo;am. Great place, ain&rsquo;t it? Do you think we
could see the president? I&rsquo;d like to see how he
looks in his place. I helped put him there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hale spoke with the glow of personal pride, and
with the sense of personal ownership the American
feels in the ruler he has helped to raise to power,
and is just as ready to pull down if he doesn&rsquo;t do
all things to suit him.</p>

<p>Pusey and Hale were back again before Garwood
had finished the coffee and roll which he had ordered
sent to his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, boys,&rdquo; he said, speaking with his
mouth full of the roll, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be at your service presently.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>What have you been doing to kill the time?
Seeing the sights?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we went up to look at the president,&rdquo; said
Hale, for Pusey was looking out of the window
with his usual lack of interest, until a belated fly
crawled torpidly over the cold pane, and then he
tapped at it with his little stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See him?&rdquo; asked Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, couldn&rsquo;t get near him. Guess he&rsquo;s got the
swelled head, hain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know he&rsquo;s busy. Possibly he was
at a cabinet meeting. Let&rsquo;s see, is this Friday?
I&rsquo;ll fix it for you though. I&rsquo;ll take you over to see
him before you go back. When&rsquo;d you get in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just got here this morning,&rdquo; said Hale. &ldquo;I
come to talk over with you that little matter
about&mdash;&rdquo; He looked all around the room as if
spies were concealed somewhere, &ldquo;about the post-office
at Pekin&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Garwood, with unusual cheerfulness
for a congressman when a post-office is mentioned,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood got up, with a wrench of pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I feel old this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you well?&rdquo; asked Hale, solicitously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a touch of rheumatism, I reckon&mdash;head
aches, too, like the devil. Wait till I kiss the
baby good by and I&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went into the adjoining room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fond of his family, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Hale, approvingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve heard as much intimated,&rdquo; answered
Pusey.</p>

<p>Garwood returned with his overcoat and hat and
gloves, and they went out. He spent the day with
them, tramping about through the rain, and at night
took them to the theater, one of the sacrifices a
congressman must make when his constituents
come to Washington.</p>

<p>When he returned to the hotel at midnight, and
went up to his rooms, he found his wife sitting
before a fire she had had laid in the grate. She
was dressed and her little traveling-bag stood on
the marble-top center table, with her hat and veil
and rolled-up gloves beside it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he said, in surprise, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned and lifted to him a face that was
stained with tears. Then she rose, holding out her
arms towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerome!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;going home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;Em&mdash;dearie! What&rsquo;s the matter! Tell
me, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; He had gone close to her
and taken her in his arms, and he made his question
the demand of a man who does not like to deal with
tears:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, I say, tell me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tone of terror had got into his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; She drew a telegram from the bosom
of her dress, and held it toward him. When he
took it, she hid her face on his breast and shook
with great sobs.</p>

<p>He took the telegram with his free hand, flirted
it open and read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Your father ill. You had better come home at
once.</p>

<p class="right no-indent">Dr. G. S. Larkin.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor G. S. Larkin!&rdquo; Garwood said, repeating
the signature, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s like him, to sign it Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Jerome,&rdquo; his wife cried, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s of no
importance&mdash;how he signs it&mdash;now.&rdquo; And she
wept afresh, as if he had added an affront to her
misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there, dear, don&rsquo;t cry. It&rsquo;s all right. Must
you go, think?&rdquo; He released her and she sank into
the chair again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she moaned, drooping toward the
fire, &ldquo;I must go at once. Oh, you were so long in
coming! I needed you so, and wanted you so! I
ought to have gone on that train to-night.&rdquo; She
shook her head slowly from side to side. &ldquo;Poor,
lonely old man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words half enraged Garwood, but he kept
silent. He did not know what else to do&mdash;only to
wait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s baby?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sleeping,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in there.&rdquo; She waved
her hand wearily toward the door. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all ready&mdash;we&rsquo;re
<i>all</i> all ready. When can we go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t leave now until to-morrow,&rdquo; he
said, trying to be tender with her. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you
better get to bed and get some rest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;no&mdash;no,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dear, you&rsquo;ll need your strength, you must
try; think of baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little fellow!&rdquo; she said, as though he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>been deserted. She clasped her knee in her hands
and rocked back and forth. Garwood was silent,
looking at her helplessly.</p>

<p>She grew calmer after awhile, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor little visit was doomed from the first;
I knew it, Jerome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, now, don&rsquo;t look at it that way,&rdquo; said Garwood,
in a big round voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon be back,
father&rsquo;ll be better; he&rsquo;s all right. You can bring
him back with you, and we&rsquo;ll have a good time here
all together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head hopelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go telegraph, Jerome; tell them when I&rsquo;m
coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood was glad to escape to the office and the
bar.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ANKIN had been at home all day, helping his
wife with the washing. The larder was growing
lean in the Rankin home, though Rankin
himself laughed with his usual optimism, and said
that it would be all right again in a few days. The
evening had come and he had gone out into the
yard to do his chores. Though the air was cold he
was in his shirt sleeves, and he went about his work
singing loudly the staves of an old hymn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;There is a land of pure delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where saints immortal reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In-fi-nite day&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; his wife&rsquo;s voice called from the back door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeoup!&rdquo; he shouted back, and then sang on:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;excludes the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An&rsquo; pleasures banish pain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;There everlastin&rsquo; spring abides,&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeoup!&rdquo; he shouted, as the call came the second
time. &ldquo;Whatch y&rsquo; want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; never-with&rsquo;rin&rsquo; flowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, like a narrow sea, divides<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This heavenly land from ours.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p>Rankin stooped in the anguish of a fat man, and
gathered up an armful of the kindlings he had
been splitting, and started toward the house. As
he stamped up the steps into the kitchen, he sang
on:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Sweet fields beyond the&mdash;&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, kid,&rdquo; he suddenly said, interrupting his
own song, &ldquo;where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched out his right arm and covering his
little son&rsquo;s head with his big palm he rolled it
round and round on the boy&rsquo;s shoulders as he
passed. And then suddenly Rankin felt a strange
unnatural chill in the atmosphere of his home.
There was the supper table laid, the baby was already
sitting up to it, pounding his tin waiter hungrily
with his spoon, while his little sister tried to
distract his attention from his own hunger by cutting
antics on the dining-room floor.</p>

<p>The pleasant odor of fried potatoes filled the
kitchen, the coffee steamed in the pot, its fragrant
aroma had reached him even in the woodshed. It
was the hour of all others in the day that he liked;
he would take the tin pan presently out to the cistern
pump and blow like a porpoise as he washed
his face, then he would swing the pan at arm&rsquo;s
length, scattering the water afar, and come groping
into the kitchen toward the long towel that hung
in an endless belt on a roller behind the door. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>then they would have supper, and he could joke his
little wife and his little boy, and give the baby prohibited
tid-bits from his plate.</p>

<p>He felt the change in the atmosphere again as he
sat down to the supper table, and yet he did not
reason about such things, or probe their causes
deeply. He thought it was their poverty that was
worrying his wife. That cloud sometimes darkened
the home for them of late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, cheer up,&rdquo; he said, as he sat down to
the table, his coat still off; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re poor but honest
parents. Remember, Mollie, what the good Book
says: &lsquo;I have never seen the righteous forsaken,
ner his seed beggin&rsquo; bread.&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t qualify under
the first clause, but I can under the second. There
never was a better man than your Grampa Rankin,
Willie. How&rsquo;d ye get along at school to-day?&rdquo; he
asked presently, still addressing the boy. &ldquo;You
want to get a hump on yourself; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to put
you in Jerry Garwood&rsquo;s office one o&rsquo; these days,
an&rsquo; make a lawyer of you, ye know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But try as he would to rally them he failed, and
he looked curiously at last from his son to his wife,
and back again. Then it dawned upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look&rsquo;e here,&rdquo; he said, placing his fists on the
table, his knife sticking up from one, his fork from
the other, &ldquo;you two&rsquo;s got some pleasant surprise
fer papa; I can see it in your faces. Le&rsquo;s see, is
this my birthday? What kind of a game&rsquo;re you an&rsquo;
mama puttin&rsquo; up on the old man, anyhow?&rdquo; He
looked at his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said his wife, and her tone almost froze
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>him. He looked at her motionless, his mouth and
eyes open. &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, &ldquo;the
postmaster&rsquo;s been appointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped his knife and fork, a sudden gleam
came to his eyes, then the grin broke out all over
his big face. He stretched out his hand to wool his
boy&rsquo;s head again, when his wife looked across the
table at him and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, no&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;you don&rsquo;t understand. It&rsquo;s
not you&mdash;it&rsquo;s Pusey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her in utter silence for a minute,
his wife looking at him with tears in her eyes, and
her son trying hard to swallow the lump that came
into his throat when mother cried. The little girl
looked up with big eyes; even the baby was still.
At last Rankin spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willie heard it, down town, on his way home
from school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; he said doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hones&rsquo;, papa,&rdquo; the boy protested, as if his
veracity had been impugned, &ldquo;cross my heart it&rsquo;s
true! It&rsquo;s hangin&rsquo; up down town in front of the
telegrapht office, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s in the paper, too. I heard
<i>ever&rsquo;body</i> talkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout it, hope to die I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin stared at his son an instant, and then
slowly turned his gaze on his wife. A look had
come into his face which it grieved her to see, a
look of utter, despairing anguish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim, you know you mistrusted something, you
know you did. You&rsquo;d never own up to it, but you
know you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span></p>

<p>Rankin&rsquo;s lip quivered, and then, suddenly, he
bent his elbows, put his arms on the table before
him, and bowing his curly head upon their enormous
muscles he burst into tears. His huge back
heaved with his sobs, and his wife, hastening
around to him, put her arms about his shoulders,
laid her thin cheek to his curly hair, and then as her
own tears rained fast, she said at last:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Jimmy, don&rsquo;t; you&rsquo;ll break my heart. I
wouldn&rsquo;t mind it&mdash;you can get somethin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; came his voice, &ldquo;but I thought
he was my friend, I thought he was my friend. I
made that boy, an&rsquo; I was so proud of him. An&rsquo;
now&mdash;an&rsquo; now&mdash;he&rsquo;s thrown me down, he&rsquo;s thrown
me down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ceased his sobbing and was still. His wife
stood by him, patting him now on the back, now
running her fingers through his curls. At last he
raised himself, rubbed the tears from his eyes, and,
pulling out his handkerchief, blew his nose with a
mighty blast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your supper&rsquo;ll get cold. The old man&rsquo;s a fool,
hain&rsquo;t he, Fannie?&rdquo; He looked at his little daughter,
and then in turn at them all, saw their tear-stained
faces, and then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; a pleasant home an&rsquo; fireside
campaign fer ye here, hain&rsquo;t I? But I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve
it, that&rsquo;s all, I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve Jerry Garwood &rsquo;uld
throw me down, without some good reason. I
won&rsquo;t believe it yet. There&rsquo;s some explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; his wife smiled proudly at him, &ldquo;they
say you&rsquo;re a hardened old politician, but you&rsquo;ve got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>too soft a heart. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that somethin&rsquo;
&rsquo;as up last summer when you got back from Pekin?
Didn&rsquo;t I tell you somethin&rsquo; &rsquo;as up when you told me
Pusey had gone down to Washington? Didn&rsquo;t I
tell you you&rsquo;ll better go or you&rsquo;d get left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, Mollie,&rdquo; he began apologetically,
&ldquo;you know I didn&rsquo;t have the price in the first place,
an&rsquo; secon&rsquo;ly, Jerry told me, <i>told</i> me, with his own
lips, right down there in that old office o&rsquo; his&rsquo;n,
that it was&mdash;all&mdash;right, that I needn&rsquo;t worry, that
he&rsquo;d promised it, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d get it. An&rsquo; what &rsquo;uld I
want to run down to Washin&rsquo;ton botherin&rsquo; him
&rsquo;bout it any more fer? You know congressmen
don&rsquo;t want the&rsquo;r constits trailin&rsquo; &rsquo;round after &rsquo;em
down there.&rdquo; He leaned back in his chair and
spread his hands wide, as if to exculpate himself
entirely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve been in politics long enough to
know&mdash;&rdquo; began his wife with a faint little sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, course,&rdquo; Rankin interrupted her, &ldquo;if it &rsquo;ad
been anybody else, I mightn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been so easy. I&rsquo;d
a camped on his trail till he done it, but Jerry&mdash;Jerry&mdash;I
never thought it o&rsquo; him.&rdquo; He shook his
head sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jim, just look here a minute,&rdquo; his wife
returned. &ldquo;You told me yourself that you noticed
a change in him when he come home from Washington
las&rsquo; summer. Now, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe there was a little, but that &rsquo;as all
right. I expected that, I expected that as he growed
bigger an&rsquo; greater, an&rsquo; got in &rsquo;ith all them heavy
timbers down to Washin&rsquo;ton he&rsquo;d naturally grow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>away from us some. I knowed he couldn&rsquo;t al&rsquo;ays
have a big dub like me trailin&rsquo; along, but I thought
he&rsquo;d al&rsquo;ays be my friend. I thought he&rsquo;d keep his
word.&rdquo; His eyes widened as he lapsed into abstraction.</p>

<p>But presently he roused himself with a mighty
shake, and reached across the table with his coffee-cup
in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another cup, Mollie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
it,&rdquo; he insisted, setting his jaw, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it.
I&rsquo;ll go down town to-night an&rsquo; find out about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife shook her head with a little smile that
told what an amiable hopelessness there was about
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when you find out it&rsquo;s true, what&rsquo;ll you
do then?&rdquo; she asked, as she gave him back his cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, sucking in his mustache, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
live on here in Polk County, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll continue to
have three square meals <i>per</i>. But Jerry&rsquo;ll have
some explanation, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t doubt that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rankin
dryly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The news of the illness of old Ethan Harkness&mdash;men
had begun to call him old when he ceased to
work&mdash;had been of interest to Grand Prairie, and
the return of his daughter from Washington had
added a zest to the interest, but it was all forgotten
in the announcement that Pusey had been appointed
postmaster.</p>

<p>It had been so generally recognized that Rankin
was to have the appointment, that Grand Prairie
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>had been denied its quadrennial sensation of a
post-office fight, and the only feeling that the boys
had been able to display was one of impatience to
have Rankin, as a deserving and efficient party
worker, displace the old postmaster the instant the
new president was inaugurated. Garwood had
explained time and again that the president was
determined to permit all present office-holders to
fill out their terms before appointing new ones, and
he had strengthened his explanation by reminding
them that the civil service rules were so strict that
there was no prospect of dislodging the present incumbents
of post-office places and putting new men
in their stead.</p>

<p>Garwood of course sympathized with the boys;
he didn&rsquo;t believe in civil service reform himself; but
preferred, he said, the good old Jacksonian doctrine
of &ldquo;to the victors belong the spoils,&rdquo; but they must
all see how powerless he was. Interest in the post-office
situation accordingly had declined, and the
subject was scarcely ever mentioned, except to
illustrate, in curbstone arguments, the absurdities
of civil service reform. But when the appointment
was made public, and the boys realized that after all
Rankin&rsquo;s premption had not held valid, and that
the field had been open all the time, they felt they
had been the victims of a conspiracy, and had been
cheated of one of the rights vested inalienably in
the politician, if not in the people.</p>

<p>Pusey announced his own appointment in the
<i>Citizen</i>, simply enough and modestly enough, and
in the same issue he referred to the appointment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>of Joseph Hale as postmaster at Pekin. In another
column there was a long leaded article headed
&ldquo;Special Washington Correspondence,&rdquo; and signed
with the editor&rsquo;s initials, and it told of his trip to
Washington, of his meeting with the great president,
and of the excellent public services their own
congressman, the Hon. Jerome B. Garwood, was
performing. And then it went on with grave and
learned dissertations on political subjects, uttered
with as much authority as the Washington correspondents
of the New York and Chicago newspapers
assume when they sit down to write their
daily misrepresentation of political life at Washington.</p>

<p>Pusey received his congratulations without a
change of expression. He went tapping along the
sidewalk with his little stick, plucking at the vagrant
hairs on his chin and chewing the stogy he
was smoking, as if nothing of moment had happened.
If the fact that he had risen in Grand
Prairie to a place of power and influence impressed
Freeman H. Pusey, his wizened face never displayed
it.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Emily got out of the frowzy day
coach in which she had made the last
stage of her long journey from Washington
and glanced along the station platform, a sense
of her loneliness, made more acute because the ugly
scene was otherwise homelike and familiar, rolled
over her. She had wired Doctor Larkin from
Olney, where she had left the St. Louis sleeper,
but no one was there to meet her, not even old
Jasper. She gasped at this last of all the evil portents
of the twenty-four hours that had dragged
by like so many weeks since she bade Jerome good by
in Washington&mdash;her father must be worse, they
could not leave him.</p>

<p>The night was cold, with a dampness that pierced
her marrow, after the foul atmosphere of the overheated
car. It had been snowing; some of the
heavy saturated flakes lay in patches, but now a
fine mist was falling, and the greasy boards of the
station platform shone in all the reflected lights of
the tired and panting train. With the weary nurse
and the healthy baby that slept through all these
trials in which it was not as yet his lot to share,
she clambered into the old hack that always stood
there, and there was something of a welcome in
the face of the driver as he held the door a moment
to inquire:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To Mr. Harkness&rsquo;s, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slammed the door and they rattled away. She
was glad that he had spoken of her father as one
still alive, and all the way home, as they went
lurching and splashing through the December mud
that mired the streets, she built her hopes upon this
little omen.</p>

<p>The old house was dark, and the trees in the
yard stirred mournfully in the winds that were
creeping up from the west. One dim light shone
normally in the hall, but another, unusual and sinister,
shone in the room above&mdash;her father&rsquo;s room.
The window was closed&mdash;she was glad of that.
Both of the lights were so dim that they seemed
only to point the gloom that had settled stilly on
the whole place.</p>

<p>The doctor, coming forward with the soft tread
and monitory finger of the sick room, met her in
the hall. She rushed to him, and seized his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor smiled with professional reassurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s better this evening. I&rsquo;ve told him
you were coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears came into her eyes and moistened the veil
she hurriedly unwound. She tore off her wraps,
and laid her hat on the hall tree. She rubbed her
palms briskly together, pressed her fingers to her
hair and her temples, and then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to him at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started for the stairs, but paused there, leaning
wearily on the baluster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Doctor, tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the medical man said, &ldquo;a general collapse.
He was out Wednesday, and it rained, and
he caught cold. Thursday he developed a bad
attack of the grippe&mdash;and his heart action is weak,
you know. He would not give up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that was like him,&rdquo; said Emily, as people
always say of their loved ones at such a time, in the
effort to recognize their strong qualities ere it be
too late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would not give up until Friday, but I made
him go to bed then. The next day I feared his
lungs were involved&mdash;he did not wish me to send
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily was blinking back her tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought it best. He will improve now, I
am confident, and if we can control the pulmonary
difficulty, I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had turned and hastily gathering her skirts,
ran up the stairs. She hesitated a moment in
the doorway of his room, and by the dim light
of the tiny star of gas saw the outlines of the
form under the white counterpane. She fluttered
across to the bed, and sank softly beside him. She
laid her hand on his hot dry brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;I&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man stirred and tried to turn his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a long ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to nurse you, and make you well,&rdquo;
she said with a cheer in her voice of which her
heart was void.</p>

<p>The doctor pleaded for a trained nurse, but
Emily, with the old-fashioned prejudice of women,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>indignantly refused, as though the mere idea involved
some reflection upon her own powers, and
her own constancy. For a week she watched by
his side, and waited on him, taking his temperature
hourly, and keeping a clinical chart like those she
had seen in the hospitals, in the old days of her
charities, determined that the lack of a trained
nurse should not be felt. And then the congestion
in his lungs passed, he breathed easily once more,
his fever broke, and he lay, weak and faint, but
smiling at her.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span></p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-XXIII">XXIII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ARKNESS gained steadily for a week, and
then he began to grow restless and intractable.
His whims and exactions exhausted
Emily&rsquo;s strength, and when he could think of nothing
else for her to do, he at last demanded that she
read to him, and she had to settle to this labor,
though her spirits wholly lacked that sense of leisure
and repose so necessary to the enjoyment of such a
task. He chose his old favorite, Scott, and for hours
each afternoon, until the early twilight gathered in
the room, she read to him from the novels he had
loved so long. It was a test of her devotion, for she
had long since outgrown Scott, as she had been fond
of declaring, but he would not hear to Howells, nor
Meredith, nor Hardy, nor any of the moderns.</p>

<p>One afternoon the doctor entered the room in
the midst of the reading. He heard Emily&rsquo;s low,
placid voice as he noiselessly approached the room
upstairs where his patient lay:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At length the Norman received a blow which,
though its force was partly parried by his shield,
for otherwise nevermore would De Bracy have
again moved limb, descended yet with such violence
on his crest that he measured his length on the
paved floor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily closed the book upon her finger as he
entered and stood just inside the door with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>smell of the cold air and his own cigar upon him,
but her father reared himself on his elbow, and,
shaking his tousled gray head, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just storming a castle, Doc. You sit
down and wait, and then I&rsquo;ll attend to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re getting along all right without
me any more,&rdquo; he said. And Emily took up her
tale:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Yield thee, De Bracy,&rdquo; said the Black Champion,
stooping over him, and holding against the
bars of his helmet the fatal poniard&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was bolstered up in a big chair by the time
Christmas drew on, and Emily was bustling happily
about the house hanging wreaths of holly in
the windows, and striving to draw out of all the
uncertainties of the time a spirit of holiday warmth
and cheer. She wrote Jerome all the details of the
little celebration she was planning, and warned him
to be home in time to hang up the baby&rsquo;s stocking
for Christmas. By way of further inducement she
said she had many things to tell him, though they
could hardly have piqued his curiosity, for she
straightway proceeded to relate them. She had had,
for instance, a long letter from Dade, announcing
dramatically that she and her mother were coming
home. They were tired of Europe, and her engagement
with the German baron was broken. She
felt, after all, so she wrote, that she would rather
marry an American&mdash;as if marriage were the whole
duty of woman.</p>

<p>The ugly stories about Pusey&rsquo;s appointment as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>postmaster, and of the dire results to follow, had
reached Emily, penetrating even to that shaded
sick room, but of these she did not write. She had
too many perplexities already, and with a power she
could command in certain mental crises she put
this subject aside, awaiting Jerome&rsquo;s coming and
his explanation, and resolutely setting her heart
toward the happier aspect of things she was always
seeing in the future.</p>

<p>Congress adjourned for the holidays on Wednesday,
but it was not until the following Monday
that Garwood reached Grand Prairie. Emily had
expected him Friday; the Chicago congressmen,
as she had read in the newspapers of that city, had
reached home on that day, been duly interviewed,
and allowed to lapse into their customary obscurity,
but Jerome delayed and no word came. When he
did drive up to the house Monday evening, tired
and worn with traveling, he explained that a conference
had detained him. Emily did not display
her usual interest in politics by pressing for details
of the conference. There were things, she
was slowly learning, that it were better to let pass.</p>

<p>She had kept his supper warm for him, and as
soon as he had cleansed himself of the stains of
travel, and had a look at the baby sleeping rosily
in his crib, she had it laid in the dining-room. She
sat across the table from him with the coffee urn
before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s better&mdash;but weak. He must not go out
this winter. His heart&rsquo;s affected,&rdquo; she whispered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>turning about with the soft-voiced mystery of a
secret. &ldquo;He mustn&rsquo;t know it. He&rsquo;s in low spirits,
and the doctor says I&rsquo;ll have to stay more closely
with him and watch him.&rdquo; Her voice fell as she
repeated this judgment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m,&rdquo; Garwood mused. He stirred the
sugar into his coffee, and then, as if seeking livelier
topics, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Dade&rsquo;s coming home, is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; isn&rsquo;t it too bad about her engagement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think not&mdash;those foreigners are mostly a
bad lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says she&rsquo;ll have to marry an American.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she have to get married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seems to think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother well?&rdquo; Garwood asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you must go right over and see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty tired to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, Jerome, but it wouldn&rsquo;t do. You
must go right away when you have done your
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of all the necessary topics,
Garwood rather hesitatingly approached the subject
that lay on the hearts of both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does the post-office appointment seem to
strike them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kept his eyes downward on the cigarette he
was pinching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear much about it,&rdquo; Emily answered.
And she colored. &ldquo;You read the papers, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>anything from them. What did you think of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was surprised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surprised?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A heavy silence fell, and Emily sat there, her
eyes on the silver sugar bowl she slowly fitted to a
design in the tablecloth. Her lips, though, were
set, and Garwood, stealing a glance at them, moved
uneasily. Here was the first of his constituents he
must reckon with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Pusey&rsquo;ll make a good postmaster,&rdquo; he
ventured at last, seeing that she was not likely to
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I hardly thought,
though, that political appointments were a question
of fitness nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were a civil service reformer,&rdquo;
Garwood answered, trying to laugh. But her lips
remained obdurately tight, and he saw what her
conscience would hold him to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had supposed Mr. Rankin was to be appointed
postmaster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood did not reply at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rankin seems to have become quite a protg of
yours,&rdquo; he ventured at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to feel,&rdquo; she promptly replied, &ldquo;that we
were in some sort protgs of <i>his</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood could not contain himself longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m getting tired of having people talk
as if Jim Rankin owned me! I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he
ended stubbornly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Jerome,&rdquo; she said, raising her eyes at last,
and fixing them on his, &ldquo;you promised him&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wadded his napkin and flung it petulantly on
the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it goes!&rdquo; he said, as he scraped back his
chair. &ldquo;I supposed some such story would get out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>

<p>Under her insistence he arose from the table
irascibly. He stood looking at her while a hard
smile rose to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deeply concerned for Rankin, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerome,&rdquo; she said quietly, looking at him with
wide, unwinking eyes, &ldquo;it is not Mr. Rankin I am
concerned for&mdash;not for him half so much as for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was led into sarcasm for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite solicitous&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and then
evidently thinking better of it, he tried to laugh
her out of her seriousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Em,&rdquo; he said patronizingly, as he
lighted his cigarette, &ldquo;you women can never understand
politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We understand honor, though,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;although
men, in their personal way of allotting the
attributes to the sexes, say we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave her a reproachful look, and left.</p>

<p>When he had gone, she went to her own room.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>Her heart was beating wildly. &ldquo;I never spoke so
to him before,&rdquo; she wailed in her heart. &ldquo;I never
spoke so to him before!&rdquo; And then she flung herself
full length across her bed, and burst into the
tears that had long been flooding her heart to the
very brim.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="II-XXIV">XXIV</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ARWOOD came out the little door in the
oaken partition that walled the private office
of the postmaster at Grand Prairie, buttoned
his long overcoat carefully about him, and
drew on his gloves.  He had been basking for half
an hour in the loyal gratitude of the newly successful
office-seeker, fur he had just left Pusey sitting
rather uncomfortably at the well-ordered desk to
which he had succeeded, whereon there were as
yet no dirty paste pot, no enormous scissors, and no
cockroaches fleeing from the wrath to come.</p>

<p>What qualms Emily had raised in Garwood&rsquo;s
breast the night before had been wholly soothed by
the adroit little editor who now was become the
artful little postmaster, and in the outlining of
Pusey&rsquo;s convincing plans for a strong and resistless
machine, not only in Polk County, but in the entire
district, Garwood felt the sweetness of a new security
steal over him. He passed down by the long
rows of lock-boxes, their little red numbers showing
smartly on their little brass doors, and turned
toward the wall to avoid the crowd that pressed up
to the stamp window to have their Christmas
packages weighed and mailed. Suddenly he saw
Rankin.</p>

<p>The big fellow was coming on breathing heavily,
with his overcoat flapping wide and his hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>thrust deep in its outer pockets. His slouch hat
was back on his brow, which was beaded with perspiration,
and the drizzle of the holiday rain clung
to his ruddy mustache. Garwood&rsquo;s heart leaped
into his throat when he saw him and he felt his
lips draw tense with nervousness, but he made one
mighty effort, and had himself under control before
Rankin raised his eyes to recognize him. In
an instant they were face to face. Garwood smiled
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim, my boy,&rdquo; he cried cheerily, &ldquo;how are you?
I&rsquo;m glad to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin halted, his hands still plunged deep in
the pockets of his overcoat. His face grew redder,
if possible, while Garwood&rsquo;s became very white.
Rankin looked Garwood all over, from his carefully
dented hat to his boots, still showing the shine he
had had put on them at the Cassell House, though
their soles were now caked with the rich Illinois
mud the farmers had dragged into town on their
wagon wheels. He looked him all over carefully,
and then, with a contemptuous little laugh:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;be&mdash;damned!&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>

<p>Garwood withdrew the hand he had outstretched
and held there so awkwardly, but he fancied there
might be hope for him in Rankin&rsquo;s words, which
would have served him as well to express his
abundant good nature in other exigencies, as they
did to show his anger and surprise in this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;d have the nerve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood flushed. The shuffle of feet on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>tiled floor had died into an attentive stillness.  He
knew that the throng was looking on absorbed in
this most interesting meeting that all the possibilities
of chance could have brought about in Grand
Prairie that day. Garwood flushed and longed to
escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he began, in a confidential tone,
&ldquo;over to my office. I was just going to hunt you
up. I wanted to have a talk with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you wasn&rsquo;t, either,&rdquo; Rankin exploded, &ldquo;you
damned liar you, you wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to hunt me up;
you know it, an&rsquo; I know it. You &rsquo;as afraid to see
me, you big stiff, an&rsquo; you haven&rsquo;t got an&rsquo;thin&rsquo; to say
to me either. I&rsquo;ve had enough o&rsquo; your <i>talk</i> now,
an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want no more of it. What talkin&rsquo; &rsquo;s
done hereafter, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> do myself, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll begin it right
now, an&rsquo; right here&mdash;this place&rsquo;s good as any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood had drawn himself erect, and was
struggling with his congressional dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me pass, sir!&rdquo; he said, as sternly as he
could.</p>

<p>Rankin drew a hand from his coat pocket, and
stretched it toward Garwood. The congressman
threw up his forearm as if to ward a blow, but
Rankin caught him by the collar of his coat. He
smiled pityingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t git skeered,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remove your hand from me instantly, sir!&rdquo;
said Garwood, white with rage.</p>

<p>But Rankin held him fast in his big grip, and
slowly backed him to the wall, and held him there,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>his head against the colored lithograph of soldiers
decked in gala dress uniforms, hung there to lure
honest country lads to the recruiting office over at
Springfield and so into the regular army.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you listen at <i>me</i>!&rdquo; said Rankin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a liar an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re a coward; you&rsquo;re a low-down,
contemptible houn&rsquo;, you&rsquo;re a damned sight worser&rsquo;n
Pusey settin&rsquo; in there; I just tell you this to let
you know what I think o&rsquo; you. An&rsquo; now I want
to serve notice on you, here&rsquo;n now, publicly, that
Jim Rankin&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to go right on livin&rsquo; in this
man&rsquo;s town, that he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to figur&rsquo; some in politics,
that he&rsquo;s ag&rsquo;in you, an&rsquo; that you&rsquo;d best get all
you can out o&rsquo; this term in Congress, fer I give you
fair warnin&rsquo; that you&rsquo;re servin&rsquo; your last term. I&rsquo;m
ag&rsquo;in you, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; to camp down on your
trail from this on, an&rsquo; if you have the gall to show
your face fer renomination ag&rsquo;in, I&rsquo;ll make it my
business to git you&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll <i>git</i> you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin was breathing hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you can go, damn you,&rdquo; he said, and he
released his hold on Garwood.</p>

<p>The congressman stood, his eyes glaring impotent
rage out of a blank white face. They stood
thus for a full minute, and then Garwood, readjusting
his overcoat with a shrug of his shoulders,
turned to walk away. The throng that had pressed
closely about them silently parted to make a way
for him, and he passed out of their midst. Rankin
stood and gazed after him. He stood and gazed,
and the people standing by in painful silence
watched with him the figure of Garwood, rapidly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>making for the door, held as erectly and as dignifiedly
as he could, for the man had need of all his
dignity then.  Rankin watched him out of sight.
Then he turned. The crowd had found tongue,
and a hum of voices arose. Several tried to speak
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Served him just right,&rdquo; some one began, sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go to hell,&rdquo; said Rankin, brushing the
startled man aside. And then he went away, forgetting
to post the Christmas letter his wife had
intrusted to him.</p>

<p>Out in the drizzling holiday streets, Garwood
hurried along, sick with the humiliation of the
scene, but as he thought of it, his old habit of self-pity
reasserted itself, and with this ruse he tried
to lure back some of his old self-respect. So well
did he succeed that when he reached home he was
red with wrath and muttering. Emily, from her
window, saw him coming, and hastened to meet him
at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jerome, what is the matter?&rdquo; she cried,
when she saw his face.</p>

<p>He flung off his overcoat and hurled his hat at
the rack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve seen your friend, Jim Rankin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim Rankin?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What in the
world has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never was so mortified in my life! I never
endured such insolence, such ignominy, such
abuse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;tell me&mdash;dear, where was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the post-office, in the most public place in
town, before a crowd of people&mdash;Ach!&rdquo; He shook
his head in disgust and wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what did he say&mdash;tell me!&rdquo; Emily almost
screamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met him accidentally, I greeted him, I told him
I wished to see him, to talk to him. I was going
to take care of him&mdash;I had it all arranged to fix
the whole damned business&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had never sworn in her presence before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he wouldn&rsquo;t listen,&rdquo; he rushed on. &ldquo;He
poured out upon me a perfect torrent of profanity
and obscenity; it was disgusting, humiliating; I
should have struck him down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; she asked, and her tone made
her question half a plea. She bent toward him
and laid her hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I walked away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was right,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;that was the dignified
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him in her sympathy. She had all
the morning regretted her words of the evening
before, though they had not recurred to them at all
in the time intervening. And she was glad of
some excuse for ridding her breast of the conviction
out of which those words had been spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any sympathy for him at all!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;I did think&mdash;but this shows me how
wrong I was, how I misjudged you. Can you forgive
me, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held her face close to his, and he stooped and
kissed her.</p>

FOR THE PEOPLE</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>GAIN the spring had come to Illinois, spilling
the prairie flowers over the pastures, and
warming the pleasant smelling earth which
the mold-boards of the plows rolled back in rich
loamy waves to make ready for the corn. In the
town the trees rustled their new leaves in the wind
that blows forever across the miles of prairie land,
and the lawns along Sangamon Avenue were of a
tender green, as their blue grass sprouted again
under rake and roller. The birds were as busy as
men, and everywhere, under the high blue sky,
were the sounds that come with the awakening
world, the glad sounds of preparation for every
new endeavor.</p>

<p>The windows of the Harkness home were open,
their lace curtains blowing white and cool in the
young winds. Yet there, all was still. Upstairs,
on his bed, with his hands folded whitely under
the sheet that was smoothed across his breast,
Ethan Harkness lay dead.</p>

<p>They buried him at Oakwood, just outside the
town, beside the wife who had gone there so many
springs before; buried him by the bulky monument
he had raised, in his methodical business
way, long ago. Its broad base glimmered between
the trees, and from afar, the raised letters of
his name could be read. The directors of the bank
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>where he had spent his life, the bank he had
founded, testified a belated appreciation of his virtues
by adopting a long series of resolutions in
which they submissively ascribed to an all-wise and
inscrutable Providence the dispensation which they
had done their part to hasten. They ordered, too,
that the curtains of the bank be pulled down on the
day of his funeral, and the door placarded
&ldquo;Closed,&rdquo; though old Morton was kept there to
collect the notes and interest falling due that day.</p>

<p>Then some ancient citizen, who was spending his
declining years in chronicling for his own satisfaction
the insignificant happenings of each day, chiefly
the temperature and the times and local effect of
frost, reminded the city council that Harkness had
once, long years before, sat as a member of that
body, and it likewise adopted resolutions. The
local lodge of Masons took charge of his funeral,
after Doctor Abercrombie of St. James had read
the service in his beautiful voice, and recited one of
his little compositions.</p>

<p>And when Pusey had published an obituary in
his best elegiac style, all the conventions were considered
as having been duly observed, and the town
turned from its tribute to the dead, to judge Harkness
for his deeds to the living who remained behind.</p>

<p>His will was proffered for probate in the County
Court some days after his funeral. It had been
drawn ten years before, and as drawn originally,
left all his property to Emily, save a small bequest
to a sister who lived somewhere in far off New
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>Hampshire. But a codicil, drawn two years before
his death, altered this original provision. To Garwood,
he directed that one thousand dollars in cash
be paid by his executors, and the rest and residue
of his property of every kind, nature and description,
real, personal and mixed, he left in trust for
his beloved daughter Emily during her lifetime,
and at her death, to her children, heirs of her body,
in equal shares. Garwood was not named as one
of the trustees.</p>

<p>The will, of course, was not satisfactory to any
one in Grand Prairie. There were many there who
had pictured to themselves their young congressman
in the rle of a lawyer without a practice, but
with a predilection for politics, and a young wife
of independent means. They knew how well he
could cut this eminently respectable figure, and
they had some dim conception of the service he
could render in theoretical reform, if he only had
money enough to place him above the vulgar
necessities of the common politician.</p>

<p>Garwood himself suffered keenly, though his
pride was hardly touched as much as Emily&rsquo;s. He
had had dreams himself, but now&mdash;he closed his
memory to them. He even told Emily that he
would not touch the thousand dollars, but finally
consented to do so in order to please her. And
then he suddenly remembered that the mortgage
he had placed on his mother&rsquo;s house was due once
more that fall and he could think of no more pious
use than that to which to put the money. He was
consoled, however, when the inventory of the estate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>revealed the fact that Harkness&rsquo;s property had
either been vastly overestimated, or had lately
shrunk in values, and he learned in the court house
gossip of the lawyers, that certain unprofitable
investments Harkness made during the last
years of his life, had excited the fears of the bank
directors, and led them to remove him from his
wonted sphere of activity.</p>

<p>Emily, in the delicacy that embarrasses refined
natures in money matters, was glad when the business
of settling the estate was so far under way as
to require her own attention no longer. She
thought it indeed concluded, though the executors,
being old, and rich already, relished the two per
cent. commissions allowed them by law and scented
a possible extra allowance by the county judge as
a reward for faithful services. So they dragged the
settlement along, picked out the choicest notes from
Harkness&rsquo;s tin box for themselves and dreaded the
time when they would have to turn over so meaty
a carcass to the trustees, who were itching to take
hold.</p>

<p>Emily&rsquo;s grief at her father&rsquo;s death was deep, but
placid, as grief for the aged must always be. She
and Jerome lived on at the old house, though he
often bemoaned the expense of keeping up so large
an establishment, and discussed taking a smaller
place. But they stayed on there, and the summer
passed, quickly, as summers do in the intemperate
zone, where winter in one form or another rages
nine months in the year.</p>

<p>And Emily tried to think of her husband in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>old ideal of him, because she was soon to become a
mother again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was late October and old Mrs. Garwood, who
spent much of her time now with Emily, sat in
the library with her. They had a fire in the grate,
the first of the season, and it cheered the somber
room.</p>

<p>Outside the rain fell, and the wet leaves fluttering
down from the trees in the yard, brushed the
window panes before settling into the damp masses
that choked the walks and the gutters. They had
sat a long time in the bliss of silent companionship,
these two women, who, though of such a different
training and tradition, understood each other very
well.  They had been talking of housekeeping and
the increased expense of living. Old Mrs. Garwood
had sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind nothing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if my
mortgage was only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your mortgage&mdash;?&rdquo; Emily let the garment
in her fingers fall with her hands into her lap, and
looked up with the question written large in her
wide eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s due, an&rsquo; Mr. Dawson&rsquo;s pressin&rsquo; me.
Tschk, tschk, tschk! I don&rsquo;t know, unless Jerome&mdash;but
I don&rsquo;t like to bother him, poor boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; but Emily checked herself. She
took up the little dress she had been working on.
John Ethan, who had been writhing restlessly at
her feet, looked suddenly into his mother&rsquo;s face,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>and something there silenced him, so that he was
very quiet.</p>

<p>The next morning, after breakfast, she and
Jerome were alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerome,&rdquo; Emily said in the voice that made him
lay down his paper, and look up with serious eyes,
&ldquo;Jerome, I thought you were going to pay off
mother&rsquo;s mortgage for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you said so, at the time, you remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when you got your thousand dollars
from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, am I never to hear the last of that thousand
dollars!&rdquo; Garwood exclaimed, dashing his paper to
the floor. &ldquo;Must I always have that thrown up to
me! I wish I&rsquo;d never seen it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, Jerome, you told me you had paid
mother&rsquo;s mortgage with it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood looked at her angrily a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken there, I reckon, you must be
mistaken. I said, perhaps, that I would pay it off
with that, but not that I had. I did intend to, but
I had to use the money in another place. I&mdash;&rdquo; But
he could proceed no further then. He was thinking
of the big poker game in the Leland the night
the state central committee met at Springfield.</p>

<p>Emily dropped the subject from her conversation,
but she did not drop it from her thoughts.
It was with her all that day, and it was the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>thing in her mind the next morning, So incessantly
did it recur to her, that, in search of relief, she
went finally to the bank. She asked for old Morton,
and when he shuffled up to the window, she made
him go with her back to the directors&rsquo; room,
haunted as it was with memories of her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sell mortgages sometimes, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
she asked as soon as they were alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; her father&rsquo;s old clerk replied, delighted
at being consulted confidentially in matters
of finance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And could you get one for me, if I gave you the
money, and told you the one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled, as he had seen his superiors smile.
It would be a treat for him to buy someone&rsquo;s mortgage.
She told him, and he scratched his head a
moment. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s over&rsquo;t the Polk
National; I ain&rsquo;t sure now, but it seems to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, find out,&rdquo; said Emily, and the old man
started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke just like your father then,&rdquo; he said,
in a mild, reminiscent way that touched her.</p>

<p>He managed the matter for her in the end, and
she bought the mortgage by borrowing the money
of one of her trustees, who said he was glad to
advance it to her, though he was careful to take
out the interest for himself in advance.</p>

<p>Emily had the mortgage canceled, and took it
herself to her mother-in-law that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is, mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Jerome had forgotten
it. You know how neglectful he is!&rdquo; And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>she smiled, as if she had named a virtue in the
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Law, yes!&rdquo; said Mrs. Garwood, folding the
mortgage in her trembling fingers. &ldquo;Bless the boy!
He always puts things off, but he never forgets his
poor old mother in the end!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="III-II">II</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Emersons had arrived in Washington at
the beginning of February. Their trunks,
scuffed with constant travel but given a cosmopolitan
air of distinction by the <i>etiquettes</i> with
which they were plastered, were ranged around the
room in which the Emersons had quartered themselves
at the Arlington, and stood with yawning
lids, ready for Dade to dive into them after some
new toilet with which to astound the guests when
she swept into the dining-room.</p>

<p>Her mother, spent by the long winter voyage,
had collapsed upon arrival, and had taken her
meals in her room, vowing that if she could reach
Grand Prairie alive, she would never leave there
again. She was anxious now, to have Doctor
Larkin undertake her cure. No one, she assured
Dade, had ever understood her case as well as he,
and no one had ever helped her as he had helped
her. She longed to start for home immediately;
but she did not feel equal to the trip just then; it
would be necessary for her to remain in Washington
awhile and gather strength for the journey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as she lingered, Dade gloried in the
Washington spring. She had become enthusiastically
American. She visited all the guide-book
places about Washington; she said she was making
a study of American history. In a week during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>which she had met several unreconstructed rebels,
though the bloody shirt was then happily passing
as an issue in politics, she had become intensely
Southern in her sympathies. She bemoaned the
lost cause as bitterly as a widow of a Confederate
brigadier; she longed for a return of the golden
days of Southern chivalry, and she yearned ineffably
as she pictured herself on some old Virginia
plantation attended by a retinue of black slaves
whom she would have patronized so graciously and
kept so busy.</p>

<p>Each morning she bought a huge bunch of violets
from an old white-headed negro, in order to
hear his &ldquo;Lawd bless you, Missy!&rdquo; It seemed to
put her in touch with the days she never had
known, and never could know.</p>

<p>She importuned her mother, too, for details of
her ancestry, a subject in which she had never
displayed an interest before, and, though her
mother pleaded headache, she was at last enabled
to recall and body forth, though vaguely, a long
dead grandmother whom tradition pictured as a
Virginia lady, an F. F. V., in fact.</p>

<p>And then Dade&rsquo;s English accent became a Southern
dialect, and it was with a delight that had its
own regret, that she heard some one in the hotel
parlor ask her one evening what part of the South
she came from. An experienced ear would have
detected Dade&rsquo;s little deception through its inability
to localize her dialect, for if she had heard
a Virginian speak, she straightway spoke like a
Virginian, if a Kentuckian, like a Kentuckian, if a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>Georgian, then like a Georgian, and the result was
that she mimicked all and mastered the tongue of
none.</p>

<p>Yet her honesty compelled her to disclaim
Southern birth, though she qualified her denial and
regained the place she had momentarily lost in the
estimation of her interlocutor by telling him that
her family, or part of them, had come from Virginia.
Those evenings in the hotel parlor were unsatisfying,
however, and she tired of the limits its
walls set to her social evolutions.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with a joy that lent a heightened
color to her face, and showed her white teeth
in a genuine smile of welcome, that she saw approaching
her one evening across the dining-room
a young man whose stride and carriage marked
him for an officer in the regular army. His waist
was as slender and his body as correctly bent as
when he had been a shavetail just out of West
Point, though that he had seen some sort of service
was shown by his face, burned to an Apache
bronze by the sun of New Mexico.</p>

<p>He wore his civilian clothes, somewhat old in
style, with the unaccustomed air that sits on the
army officer when he is out of uniform. Dade did
not restrain the look of pleasure that comes to any
girl&rsquo;s eyes at the sight of a soldier, especially a
soldier with whom she may claim acquaintance,
and as his friendly face broke into smiles, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mistuh Beck, who would have thought
of meeting yo&rsquo; all heah! Ah thought yo&rsquo; weh aout
fighting Indians somewheah.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stationed here now,&rdquo; the young lieutenant
explained, and then: &ldquo;The world is very small!&rdquo;
he marveled, making that trite remark with the
self-evident pleasure that showed he considered it
original. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; He laid a hand tentatively
on the back of a chair at her table, and bowed low
in his pantomime of asking if he might sit with
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ce&rsquo;tainly,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Emerson is well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She takes heh meals in heh room. We ah only
waiting heah fo&rsquo; heh to recovah sufficiently to
unde&rsquo;take the journey aout to Illinois.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were so much together after that that the
ladies of the hotel, who could not have known that
the young people had become acquainted long ago
in St. Louis, reveled in a new subject for gossip
and pitied the poor woman lying ill in her room
and neglected by a daughter who spent her time
flirting with an army officer. Dade, by some spiritual
divination, apprehended all they were saying,
and took a delight of her own in shocking them.
So the flirtation raged furiously, and Dade, by
delicate pathological suggestions, developed her
mother&rsquo;s present indisposition into the disease that
was her Washington doctor&rsquo;s specialty.</p>

<p>Beck and Dade had gone to the Capitol one day,
and, when Dade expressed a wish to see how the
laws were made, had gone into the gallery of the
House. Below them the members were lolling in
their seats, their feet on their desks, reading newspapers,
yawning or chatting, while the business of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>the nation, or of the party then in power in the
nation, was being listlessly transacted.</p>

<p>The Speaker, sitting in his solemn chair, looked
small in the distance, the clerks below him bowed
over their work. Now and then the Speaker&rsquo;s voice
could be heard, now and then the sharp fall of the
gavel startled the common drone of voices. Some
member far across the House, beyond the littered
sea of desks, was speaking. His voice came to
them scarcely at all. He held a bundle of notes in
one trembling hand, with the other he now and then
pushed his spectacles up on his sweating nose.</p>

<p>A cup of water stood on his desk, and he drank
from it frequently in the agony of getting through
the ordeal that was necessary to supply the voters
in his far-away Ohio district with copies of that
speech. By the time it got into the <i>Congressional
Record</i>, it would be well parenthesized with applause,
and thus paint for his constituents a scene
of a decorous, black-coated House, hanging rapt
upon his words, and breaking occasionally into
cheers that could not be controlled. The members
lolled and read, and all about this speaker seats
were empty, standing there in wooden patience as
if waiting for him to end. At last the Speaker of
the House turned from the man to whom he had
been whispering, and his gavel fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&rsquo;s time has expired,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The Ohioan stopped, and when he asked leave
to extend his remarks in the <i>Record</i>, it was granted
with the only enthusiasm his effort had produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stupid,&rdquo; said Dade, turning to her lieutenant.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go ovah to the Senate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse there,&rdquo; Beck answered. &ldquo;This seems
to be an unexciting day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ah they talking abaout?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness knows, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly. But&mdash;wait a minute!&rdquo; The soldier
leaned over the railing. A laugh had rung below
him. Sharp words had been spoken. A question
had been flung across the House. On both sides,
Republican and Democratic, members had sprung
to their feet. The Speaker had arisen, and stood
with his gavel alertly poised. There were several
nervous cries of,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker! Mr. Speaker!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beck saw one member who had arisen with the
rest, and who now stood with one hand raised, his
finger leveled at the speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; said the member confidently.</p>

<p>The Speaker nodded in his direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman from Illinois,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The member began to speak, talking in a low
tone for several moments. Something he said provoked
a laugh around him. Then the House was
still. He was a tall man, and his long black coat
hung from heavy shoulders. As he warmed to
his subject, and his coat tails swung away from
his loins, they revealed a protuberant abdomen;
as he warmed still more, the perspiration rolled
down his cheeks and on to the neck that lay in folds
of fat over his rapidly softening collar. His voice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>increased in volume. He became excited, he turned
around in a vehement outbreak, to address directly
some member who, with head bent respectfully to
the fictions of parliamentary etiquette, had crept
in creaking boots to a desk near the speaker, and
there he now sat, a palm nursing his deaf ear. The
orator turned yet more directly about, and&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; Dade cried, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Jerry Gahwood!
He&rsquo;s ouah congressman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She craned her pretty chin forward, and leaned
her elbows on the wide marble rail to hear the
better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; Beck asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s ouah congressman! He mah&rsquo;ied
Emily Ha&rsquo;kness&mdash;don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; remembuh? The gyrl
who was with me that wintah at the Van Stohn&rsquo;s
in St. Louis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Beck.</p>

<p>She turned in the more immediate personal interest
his tone had awakened in her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do yo&rsquo; know him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? No, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood&rsquo;s voice was ringing loud and clear.
Members came in from the lobby, from the cloak
rooms, from the committee rooms. Men gathered
in the seats near Garwood to hear him the better.
Now and then there was the sharp rattle of clapping
hands.</p>

<p>Dade&rsquo;s eyes were glowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he fahn?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s handsome, too.
Ah heahd him make his great speech the night
befo&rsquo; he was elected&mdash;yo&rsquo; heahd of it, didn&rsquo;t yo&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span></p>

<p>Beck only smiled. She turned again to listen,
but her attention was not steadfast. Beck had
hardly been listening at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; think him fahn?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is really a good speaker,&rdquo; the lieutenant admitted.
Dade looked at him, fixing her brown
eyes steadily in his blue ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do yo&rsquo; all know abaout him?&rdquo; she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; he parried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; speak so strangely&mdash;yo&rsquo; ah so queah abaout
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I? I know nothing. I have been told that
he came here two or three years ago with extraordinary
prospects&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he has not&mdash;justifahd or fulfilled them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; Dade said loyally, tossing
her head, and then she turned once more to watch
Garwood.</p>

<p>His speech was brief. He finished in a fine burst
of eloquence, with a hand uplifted, and his black
locks shaking, and then sat down, amid a volley of
applause, taking the hands of those who pressed
about him, and smiling at each congratulatory
word, though disparagingly, as if his achievement
had been a small thing for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah must meet him!&rdquo; Dade announced, suddenly
arising. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go. Yo&rsquo; must send in yo&rsquo; cahd.
Can yo&rsquo;? Will they let yo&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the lieutenant hesitated, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; Dade stood at her full height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d rather not see him&mdash;here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; She stamped her foot petulantly,
and her eyes flashed dangerously. &ldquo;Ah mean to
take him to task fo&rsquo; not calling on mamma and
me. Ah&rsquo;ve known him all my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officer shrugged his shoulders. He felt that
he had already said too much, more, certainly, than
was prudent for an officer in the army, where feudal
notions of propriety still exist.</p>

<p>Garwood came out of the House in response to
the lieutenant&rsquo;s card. The air of serious and official
demeanor with which he had prepared to listen
to importunities about some of the army&rsquo;s constant
appropriation bills or reorganization bills,
relaxed into one of surprise and friendliness when
he saw Dade standing by the side of the young
officer, and it expanded into a smile of much insinuation
as he bowed low and took the girl&rsquo;s
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She presented the lieutenant, and the men bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met Lieutenant Beck before,&rdquo; Garwood
said. &ldquo;Glad to meet him again&mdash;always glad to
meet the officers of our little army, aren&rsquo;t we, Miss
Dade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was red and perspiring, and stretched his
neck now and then, that he might press his handkerchief
below his collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been listening to yo&rsquo; speech, Mistuh
Gahwood,&rdquo; Dade said. &ldquo;Ah hadn&rsquo;t heahd yo&rsquo; speak
since that night befo&rsquo; the election. Do yo&rsquo; remembuh?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; the congressman replied, and he
laughed. &ldquo;That seems years ago, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to me,&rdquo; she corrected him.</p>

<p>Garwood bowed, intensely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Miss Dade, you are the only one
who hasn&rsquo;t aged since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood had drawn a cigarette from his pocket,
and as they strolled out into the rotunda, he offered
the case to Beck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; said Beck.</p>

<p>Garwood continued pinching the cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emil&mdash;Mrs. Gahwood is not with yo&rsquo;, is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, poor girl,&rdquo; said Garwood. &ldquo;She stayed at
home this winter. It has been lonely for me, too,
without her. I had hoped to have her with me, but
she is not well&mdash;and then her father&rsquo;s death you
know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood allowed the sentence to complete in the
girl&rsquo;s mind its own impression of the lonely wife
left at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be lonesome,&rdquo; Dade said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;think of having to spend a winter in that
beastly little place!&rdquo; Garwood said, and then he
hastened to add with an apologetic smile: &ldquo;We
wouldn&rsquo;t talk that way in Grand Prairie, Lieutenant;
would we, Miss Dade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men walked with her between them, and
Garwood walked close to the girl. His eyes took
in her fresh face, glowing under the dotted veil,
and her athletic figure, which she carried as erectly
as the soldier by her side did his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were going over into the Senate.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Garwood responded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m headed in that
general direction, not to hear the old men certainly,
but down to the restaurant. This business of saving
the nation twice a day is exhausting. Perhaps
you&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank yo&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Dade, withdrawing herself
subtly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall do myself the honor of calling upon you,
Miss Dade,&rdquo; Garwood said.</p>

<p>She looked at him. Her eyes were cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mothuh will be glad to see yo&rsquo;, no doubt,&rdquo; she
answered, and then she bowed.</p>

<p>Garwood stood looking after her, watching the
delicate play of the muscles of her back as she
walked. Then he placed the cigarette between his
lips, and started for the elevators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s grown fat!&rdquo; Dade was saying to the army
officer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hoh&rsquo;id! Po&rsquo; little Emily!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="III-III">III</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T had been a long and lonesome winter for
Emily, shut up in the big house emptied of all
save its memories. She was still in mourning
for her father, and the conventionalities of a society
that demands steadfast grief in others prevented
her from seeking any diversion, even if she had had
the strength or the inclination to do so. Her only
companion, besides the servants, was her child,
now in his third year and developing a curiosity
that exhausted the little vitality that her housewifely
duties had not already demanded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Garwood found time, of course, to &ldquo;run in,&rdquo;
as she put it, every day, though her run had to
prolong itself for many blocks, and she watched
Emily with a motherly solicitude. But it was Emily&rsquo;s
heart that was lonely; she brooded constantly
over her lengthened separations from Jerome. She
had borne them bravely as long as they seemed but
necessary postponements of the life she had wished
to lead, but now it was beginning to dawn upon
her that there was a spiritual separation between
them, growing ever wider and wider, and the
thought of this wore away day by day faith and
hope, and left her sick with despair.</p>

<p>For this her mother-in-law could give her little
consolation. Not that she lacked sympathy at
heart, but the tenderness of her nature could only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>express itself in material ways. The finer qualities
of the spirit&rsquo;s yearnings which, in the case of a
nature like Emily&rsquo;s, became real necessities, she
could not appreciate. If at times she was haunted
by a crude intuition of Emily&rsquo;s subjective difficulties,
she had not the power to analyze them, and
if she had, she would have found little patience with
them.</p>

<p>The life they had led did not of course meet the
standards of her own conscience, but she was disposed
to blame Emily as much as, if not more than,
she did Jerome, and being a rigid old woman, who
would have burned at the stake for any one of her
little elementary principles, she would now, as she
had done so many times before, consistently wag
her head with the wise disapproval her years and
experience of common life warranted her in expressing,
and say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t for the best, it ain&rsquo;t for the best. You&rsquo;re
too young to be apart; it ain&rsquo;t good for you, an&rsquo;
it ain&rsquo;t good for Jerome. Young husban&rsquo;s should
be kept at home, should be kept at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, you know, mother,&rdquo; Emily would argue,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep him at home, and I can&rsquo;t be with him
there in Washington&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And her head drooped over the white garment
she was fashioning.</p>

<p>But old Mrs. Garwood inexorably shook her
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;a wife&rsquo;s place is by
her husband, an&rsquo; I s&rsquo;pose women becomes mothers
in Washington same&rsquo;s anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span></p>

<p>Emily had no strength for discussion then. It
was all at one, anyway, with the monotony of her
life.</p>

<p>It became, too, but a part of her routine to
follow political developments through the newspapers,
trying to supply the omissions in Jerome&rsquo;s
infrequent letters from the broad columns of the
<i>Congressional Record</i>, where, for the benefit of
posterity, the national politicians keep a carefully
revised record of the things they wish they had
said.</p>

<p>If she found Jerome&rsquo;s name, she read eagerly,
and then, dropping the paper in her lap, began
once more as in the past, to body forth in imagination
the whole scene&mdash;Jerome in the full flush of
his oratorical excitement, his face red, his eyes
blazing, his brow damp with perspiration, his black
hair tumbled in the picturesque way she knew, his
arm uplifted, perhaps one white cuff a little disarranged.</p>

<p>And then, the other congressmen crowding into
the seats about him, at last the &ldquo;long-continued
applause,&rdquo; which is the only thing never expurgated
from that daily magazine of fiction. In
this poor way she tried to bear herself nearer to
him, to remain by him, but it was not satisfying,
and many times after such hopeless fancy, she wept
in despair, and hugged her boy to her hungry
breast, finding in his warm little body the only
actual and substantial comfort her life now knew.</p>

<p>Emily had allowed herself to believe that serious
opposition to Jerome&rsquo;s renomination had disappeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>after his victory in his second campaign,
but when with other harbingers of spring Sprague
came forth in his perennial candidacy, and announcement
was made that with the solid delegation
of Moultrie at his disposal he would contest with
Garwood for the nomination, she realized with a
certain sickening at her heart that the same old
trial was upon them once more.</p>

<p>A few days later she read that Judge Bailey of
Mason&mdash;now Speaker of the House at Springfield&mdash;was
also an avowed candidate for Congress, and
she tried to convince herself that Jerome&rsquo;s chances
were thereby favored because of the consequent
division of the forces against him, though there
were disquieting articles in the <i>Advertiser</i> that
would not let her conviction rest.</p>

<p>The <i>Advertiser</i>, as is customary with the opposition
organ in a man&rsquo;s own town, exhibited a meanness
in its treatment of Garwood to which it would
not have descended in any cause less sacred than
that of party-ism, and it now began to speak of
Bailey in fulsome praise as if he were the savior of
his times, though all its readers knew, and especially
did Emily know, for she, doubtless, alone of
all those readers, looked so far ahead, that if Bailey
were successful before the convention, he would,
when the campaign came on, get all the abuse her
husband had been receiving.</p>

<p>But Emily had learned that editors, though they
appeared at least ordinarily honorable in other
ways, could become mendacious when they took
up political questions; she had often wondered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>why it was that, simply because they happened to
own newspapers to print them in, they could deliberately
write and publish lies they would have
scorned to use in discussing men in any of their
relations other than political, and, while she could
find no explanation except that partisanship inculcates
hypocrisy, she tried to be practical and not
credit anything she read in the newspapers, especially
if it were disagreeable.</p>

<p>Pusey had loyally begun the campaign for Garwood&rsquo;s
relection by writing daily editorials in his
praise, and these, printed in the <i>Citizen</i>, which the
postmaster continued to edit, gave Emily a welcome
antidote for the <i>Advertiser&rsquo;s</i> venom. Pusey published
all of Garwood&rsquo;s speeches in full, and the
<i>Advertiser</i>, with the relish of one who discloses
state secrets, described the little postmaster as darkly
setting up the pins for a county convention which
should select a delegation to the congressional convention
instructed to use all honorable means to
bring about the renomination of Jerome B. Garwood.</p>

<p>The <i>Advertiser&rsquo;s</i> editor, with a wit that sometimes
illumined the recesses of his mind, printed
the word &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; in quotation marks. This
account of Pusey&rsquo;s secret doings was varied at
times by a description of the conferences that were
nightly held in the back room of the post-office.
The <i>Advertiser</i> pretended to lay bare all the ramifications
of the little man&rsquo;s designs, and as if its
duty lay in the direction of its joy, did all it could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>to confound his politics and frustrate his knavish
tricks.</p>

<p>But amid all this confusion, Emily was sure of
one thing, that there was another contest, with all
its nervous strain, before her; that the months to
come, the beautiful months of the spring and summer
she had longed for as ardently as an invalid
longs for the days when he can be wheeled out into
the sun, would bring more abuse and recrimination,
more hatred and strife, and she had grown so weary
of it all. If Jerome could have become a candidate
for some other office it would at least relieve the
monotony, but this everlasting repetition of the
unchanging sordid struggle to stay in Congress&mdash;she
wished that he would leave politics altogether;
she almost wished in her bitterness, that he would
be defeated, if it would bring him home, and make
him himself once more.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="III-IV">IV</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ADE had provisionally accepted Beck&rsquo;s invitation
to the Army and Navy ball, but after
Mrs. Emerson had showed her endurance in
an Easter service at one of the fashionable
churches, there was no longer doubt that she
would postpone her return to Illinois and the resumption
of Doctor Larkin&rsquo;s treatment until that
great event should have passed into history. As
the night of the ball drew near, Beck was in a
flutter almost feminine, and Dade&rsquo;s preparations
went forward in such excitement that the old lady
herself finally awakened an interest and determined
to accompany Dade as chaperon.</p>

<p>Now that the night had come, she showed no
regret for her decision, for, with a robust floridity
that may have been but the final flowering of her
carefully nurtured ailments, she sat and fanned herself
all the evening, basking in the smiles of the
young officers Beck brought up in reliefs to keep
her from growing weary and impatient. These
war-like youths in the <i>esprit de corps</i> that had been
hazed into them at the national nursery heroically
stood at their posts, reminded, whenever they
caught a glimpse of the proud girl in the fine state
of her black chiffon gown, whirling by with their
brother officer, that the honor of the service was
being upheld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are charming, these young officers of our
army!&rdquo; the old lady whispered to Dade as they
were going out to supper. &ldquo;So much more sincere
than foreign officers, such gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of cou&rsquo;se,&rdquo; Dade replied, but more for Beck&rsquo;s
benefit than for her mother&rsquo;s, &ldquo;they ah gentlemen
bah Act of Congress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady fed recklessly on the salads and
ices, and Dade foresaw the loud alarms that
would appal the nights for a week afterwards, but
Beck observed her gastronomic exploits with satisfaction,
for it all meant time to him. Dade had
limited him to four dances, and in the wide, wide
intervals between them, he had moped in the smoking
room, just as if he were the love-sick hero of a
novel. But now he pressed his suit by urging
more dishes on the mother, and she ate gaily and
carelessly on, and drank enough coffee to insure
insomnia for the whole summer. And then after
supper, Dade went off with a mere civilian, and
left Beck and her mother to watch the brilliant
stream of uniforms flow by.</p>

<p>It was the male, who in a reversion to the barbaric
type, made a display of toilets that night, and
not the female. There were uniforms everywhere.
The embowered Marine Band, itself cutting no
mean figure in its white breeches and scarlet coats,
played the tunes that were popular that spring,
while the proud and happy men moved by in glittering
splendor&mdash;navy officers, with their gold-braided
dress coats and low waistcoats; army officers,
in the white stripes of the infantry, the yellow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>of the cavalry, or the red of the artillery; the
members of some local company of rifles in their
cadet gray and pipe-clayed cross-belts, now and
then some foreign officer in the pride of his own
pulchritude, and the happy consciousness that he
was serving nobly in that hour because his uniform
marked him out even in all that distinction of gold-mounted
clothes.</p>

<p>The members of the diplomatic corps, too, had
come with their ribbons and stars, to give the final
touch of splendor; even the Japanese and Chinese
ministers with their silks and fans were there,
gazing calmly on from the far misty distance of
their oriental lives. There were, to be sure, some
white-headed old infantry captains who had not a
sign of gold cord on their breasts, but they served
to show how unequally the real rewards of military
service are apportioned.</p>

<p>Dade could see Beck, striding here and there
over the ball room floor, trampling the trains of
gowns, with muttered apologies as angry as the
vengeful looks the ladies flung at him, but she did
not cast one glance in his direction to help him in
his quest. Rather, with her head inclined indolently,
her long arms, in their black mousquetaire
gloves, stretched straight to her knees, her fingers
knit together, she sat and talked to the black-coated
civilian, who, despite the eclipse into which
he and all his unnoticed kind were thrown by the
blaze of uniforms that night, had manfully striven
to shine in his own proper luster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span></p>

<p>Yet from the corner of her dark eye, she followed
Beck&rsquo;s frantic evolutions as he dashed in and out
among the promenading couples, assuring herself
again that she had never known how handsome
the young soldier was until she beheld him that
night for the first time in uniform. She had always
longed to see him armed and equipped, and had
frankly told him so, not at all to his discomfort or
displeasure, but she pictured him at such times as
a kind of animated Remington figure in cavalry
boots and spurs, a heavy saber hooked up at his
belt, and a six-shooter in its holster swinging ready
to his right hand; with gauntlets, too, a gray campaign
hat to shade his eyes, and a polka-dotted
handkerchief knotted at his sun-burned throat.
Then, in the violet haze of the western prairies,
a body of hardened troopers standing by, some
picketed horses, a grizzled officer with a field glass,
and perhaps some Indians on their ponies impudently
galloping in far off taunting circles, had
completed the picture her young imagination had
made of him.</p>

<p>But he had presented himself before her that
evening as the apotheosis of the full-dress uniform,
with his cavalry cape over his shoulders&mdash;though
it had one corner thrown back to give freedom to
his right arm, and possibly to show its own yellow
lining&mdash;and his helmet with its long yellow
horse-hair plume hanging to his shoulders, and
adding at least a cubit to his stature, after the cubit
of a man. When they arrived at the armory, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>had doffed the helmet and the cape, but it was
only to display himself in the more gorgeous magnificence
of his helmet cord, arranged on his breast
with an intricacy that would have bewildered a
lady&rsquo;s maid, and his heavier aiguillettes, which his
detail as aide-de-camp now entitled him to wear,
looped from his right shoulder.</p>

<p>His shoulder knots gave him an effect of greater
broadness, and when he walked his long saber
smote militantly against the wide yellow stripe that
ran down his leg. His face, tanned to a chronic
brown by the suns of the Southwest, where he had
been chasing Apaches for three years, was red to-night
with the heat and the excitement of this
social expression of the civilization he was so glad
to get back to, and his yellow hair, cropped close
in the military style, was twisting tightly at his
brow into the curls that he would have cultivated
had he been trained to some practical occupation.</p>

<p>The eclipsed civilian was glad enough when the
band struck up a waltz, and rescued him from
Dade&rsquo;s comparative studies of uniforms, for if he
did not quite recover his individuality with his
new partner, he could at least forget it in the vertiginous
mazes of the dance.</p>

<p>Dade, left alone, began to long for Beck&rsquo;s coming
to save her from the ignominy of a wallflower,
and, under the stress of this apprehension, she held
herself more stiffly with the intention of acquiring
thereby a greater visibility, and of expressing that
reproach site meant him to feel in the moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>when he should discover her thus deserted. She
could see him still dashing here and there on the
outlook for her.</p>

<p>He had left the middle of the floor where the
gyrating dancers made his position absurd and
even dangerous, and now, applying the tactics of
his arm of the service, was beating up the walls
of the room, feeling that there somewhere, his
scout must end. When he saw her at last, his perspiring
face lit up, and he bore down upon her in
triumph. He sank into the chair beside her, and,
drawing out a handkerchief, began to pat his brow
delicately with it, though he would have liked to
give his hot face a good scrubbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have yo&rsquo; all been having a good tahm?&rdquo;
drawled Dade, with her eyes far away to where
the Chinese minister was cross-examining some
woman on the subject of her age and her maiden
name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Beck said, bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah should think yo&rsquo; would,&rdquo; Dade replied,
coldly.</p>

<p>Beck looked at her in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he ventured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; seemed to have difficulty in teahing yo&rsquo;self
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beck&rsquo;s alarm became positive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been looking for you everywhere,&rdquo; he
said in earnest defense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she continued, as if to eliminate
herself from consideration as quickly as possible,
&ldquo;ah yo&rsquo; not in unifohm?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span></p>

<p>She turned toward him, and inclining her head
over her white shoulder, looked at him with an
eye to sartorial effects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you only knew how hot this dress uniform
is!&rdquo; He scoured his whole visage with his handkerchief,
and angrily pulled at the collar that was
binding his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But just think how remahkably well yo&rsquo; all
look in it,&rdquo; she said, her lips parting in a mocking
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, please,&rdquo; he said, quite seriously. &ldquo;Do
you think we live only for uniforms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Look at that red commodo&rsquo;e
theah. He comes into the hotel pahlo&rsquo;
every night buhsting in that unifohm&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t
give it up fo&rsquo; the wo&rsquo;ld.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beck smiled at the fat old sailor who was wheeling
gravely around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it weh not fo&rsquo; the unifohms we all would have
no ahmy at all,&rdquo; Dade persisted; &ldquo;it is the unifohm
that keeps the institution of milita&rsquo;ism alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be thinking deeply to-night,&rdquo; Beck
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah nevah had such a good oppo&rsquo;tunity befo&rsquo; fo&rsquo;
studying the vanity of man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could see us in the field, you wouldn&rsquo;t
think so,&rdquo; Beck said, and he managed to put the
words in the tone of one who had suffered for a
great cause.</p>

<p>Dade glanced at him. She had a glimpse of her
Remington picture again. His tone had touched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>her. She recalled all she had read of the hardships
of soldiers&rsquo; lives, and she softened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah would lahk to see yo&rsquo; all theah,&rdquo; she confessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; He spoke eagerly, leaning toward
her, gathering his saber into his lap. &ldquo;You
shall.&rdquo; His cheek flushed red under his brown
skin. He cast a glance about the armory, striving
to hide its bare walls under the flags of all nations
that had been draped there. The green plants
standing stolidly in their tubs offered no place for
a tte--tte.</p>

<p>She cast one glance his way, and then dropped
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; swo&rsquo;d theah, fo&rsquo; instance, is an emblem of
vanity,&rdquo; she went on hurriedly, in a final effort to
regain her lost note of banter, &ldquo;why do yo&rsquo; weah
it in a ball room? Ah yo&rsquo; in dangeh? No, yo&rsquo;
me&rsquo;ely wish to show that yo&rsquo; can handle it skilfully
in a dance&mdash;which yo&rsquo; can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And she
thrust a hand into a rent in her overskirt, and
spread it over her palm in proof. &ldquo;And those
things, what do yo&rsquo; call them? That helmet co&rsquo;d,
as Leftenant Wood so cahfully explained to me,
that is to hold yo&rsquo; helmet on; but yo&rsquo; haven&rsquo;t yo&rsquo;
helmet on now. And those othah things, lak pencils,
that knock in mah eyes in dancing, what good
ah they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She touched with the tip of her finger his dangling
aiguillettes. The touch thrilled him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear me?&rdquo; he went on. All her mockery
had not been heard. She knew it had not been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>heard, and she tried to say more, but her mind
would not work; she caught her breath. They
were alone on that side of the great hall. He
leaned closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear me?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You shall
see me so if you will. I&rsquo;ll take you there&mdash;will you
go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a treat, wouldn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
see yo&rsquo; on yo&rsquo; native heath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face remained serious. His jaw set.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dade,&rdquo; he said, and she flushed crimson, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
no use&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say it right&mdash;only&mdash;I love you,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hung her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear, darling?&rdquo; he continued, bending
nearer. &ldquo;Do you hear? You must excuse the
bluntness of a soldier&mdash;I love you, that&rsquo;s all there is
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He clutched the scabbard of his saber in his
nervousness. Her hand had fallen to her side,
and with his own he seized it, and crushed it between
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I love you, love you, love
you! Oh, if we were somewhere else! You can&rsquo;t
say &lsquo;No&rsquo; now; you must not! You do love me,
you must&mdash;listen, do you hear?&mdash;you must love
me! If we were elsewhere I&rsquo;d take you in my
arms&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do it anyway, here and now&mdash;what do I
care? And you couldn&rsquo;t stop me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned impulsively forward. She stirred, and
turned her face half-frightened toward him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then, do you love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes looked full in his, and then, without
dropping one of her Western r&rsquo;s, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Arthur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He crushed her hand until she winced with the
pain.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>MILY and Dade had kept up a correspondence
that gushed from their pens with all
the olden spontaneity of their girlhood,
though in the latter days this thin black-gowned
matron who paused in her household duties to sit
down to epistolary labors found it an effort which
caused her rueful smiles to assume a character that
was akin to her ancient self. Dade in her letters
from Washington had hinted darkly at a secret
she had to impart when they were, as she put it,
heart to heart again, though her constant and enthusiastic
celebration of Lieutenant Beck of the
cavalry detracted somewhat from the mystery she
was saving for Emily&rsquo;s stupefaction.</p>

<p>When it was at last announced to her that the
Emersons were about to start for Grand Prairie,
Emily welcomed the news with joy, and fondly expected
to renew in Dade that blithe girlhood which,
as she sadly realized, had gone from her. But
when Dade appeared one morning at the bottom
of the broad steps that led to the veranda of Congressman
Garwood&rsquo;s place, as the old home of the
Harknesses so soon had come to be called, and
mounted them with anything but continental stateliness,
Emily, standing in the doorway to meet her,
saw in a flash, that however ardent and however
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>intimate their letters may have been, their diverging
lives could never meet again.</p>

<p>To Emily the recognition was prompter than to
Dade, to whom, indeed, it never came at all.
Though she had roamed all over the world, Dade
had not grown in experience, unless a cosmopolite&rsquo;s
knowledge of the conveniences of travel, a
guide-book acquaintance with art galleries, and a
smattering of gossip about, if not of, the fashionable
courts of Europe could be called experience.
She still looked out upon the world with the wide
eyes of her girlhood; while Emily, though immured
in all the provincialism of her little prairie
town, had known the daily heart-ache and the
sleepless nights in which the soul sounds all the
deeps of life. So it was that out of eyes from which
the scales had fallen she looked upon Dade&rsquo;s glowing
and radiant face this May morning, and the
smile that came to her was of a longing sympathy
with the youth and girlhood that stood revealed
before her.</p>

<p>Dade, swinging the jacket she had been carrying
on her arm, caught Emily about the waist and led
her into the house at a livelier step than she
had known for many a day. Emily took her upstairs,
where they could be near the new baby,
who was taking a morning nap, and once in the
old familiar room that Dade had known as Emily&rsquo;s
in their girlhood, she plumped Emily down on the
box couch, then plumped herself down beside her,
and when the vibration of the springs had spent
itself, and she had ceased to bounce up and down,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>Dade impetuously turned, and fixing her eyes on
Emily under the brim of the mannish alpine hat
she wore, she seized the matron by both shoulders
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Em, Ah&rsquo;m engaged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; smiled Emily, with the indulgence of
the elder woman to a girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Again!</i>&rdquo; cried Dade, repeating Emily&rsquo;s word,
and arching her brows. She released her hold of
Emily&rsquo;s shoulders, and throwing her arms behind
her, rested on them like two props, while she regarded
Emily with a mimicry of reproach. But
her black eyebrows twitched disobediently in the
mirth that was turbulent that day in her whole
being.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; she repeated, trying to prolong the
pose. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; speak as if mah husband was d&rsquo;aid,
and Ah&rsquo;d been mah&rsquo;ied the second tahm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily gave a little distant laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, dear,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Dade regarded her curiously, and then instantly
voiced her thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; all talk lak some kind old auntie!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Why, gyrl, yo&rsquo; ahn&rsquo;t old&rsquo;s Ah am. Mah heaht&rsquo;s
wohn to a frazzle. Ah&rsquo;ve been engaged befo&rsquo;, oh,
a dozen tahms, Ah reckon&mdash;mo&rsquo;n yo&rsquo; all evah
dreamed of!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dozen times!&rdquo; exclaimed Emily, in real
amazement, and then with a touch of the spirit of
their old intimacy she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you never told me, Dade, only that once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Co&rsquo;se not,&rdquo; said Dade; &ldquo;they really didn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>count. Ah was on and off with them so quick.
Ah wanted to wait to see if&mdash;if&mdash;the&rsquo;d <i>take</i> befo&rsquo;
writing yo&rsquo;, but they nevah did, only the one with
the baron, po&rsquo; ol&rsquo; soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did that one take?&rdquo; asked Emily, with a languid
return to the remoteness her own experience
had drawn her to, and with a sigh, also, that her
heart so quickly lost the perfume of the youth that
a moment before had been wafted into it.</p>

<p>Dade was serious an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. Ah thought it did, but yo&rsquo; know,
Em, those Eu&rsquo;opeans ah simply <i>im-possible</i>, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were engaged to twelve of them! I
thought the chaperon was an institution in Europe.
Yours couldn&rsquo;t have watched you very carefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re just to see that the gyrls <i>dew</i> mah&rsquo;y
some one&mdash;that&rsquo;s all&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You escaped?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s different with an Ame&rsquo;ican gyrl, yo&rsquo;
know; they won&rsquo;t be watched, and Ah escaped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dade had raised her arms to her head, with a
graceful preliminary flourish to loosen her sleeves
at the elbows, and was withdrawing the pins that
fastened her hat. Emily noticed that the pins
were all headed with army buttons, with the &ldquo;C&rdquo;
on their bright little shields that told of the despoilment
of some cavalryman&rsquo;s forage cap. She connected
these with the buckle Dade wore on her
belt, the plain buckle of the West Point cadet&rsquo;s
belt, though over the washed gold of this one was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>a monogram of the initials of Dade&rsquo;s name, &ldquo;D.E.,&rdquo;
in silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahthu&rsquo; says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Dade began, stabbing the
pins back into the hat, and flinging it beside her
on the couch, &ldquo;Oh, Em, he&rsquo;s the deahest man&mdash;pe&rsquo;fectly
scrumptious! Ah must tell yo&rsquo; abaout
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she began a celebration of the young soldier,
setting him in what was to her the picturesque
atmosphere of a western army post, and drawing
once more, in all its details, the picture she had
imagined of him, booted and spurred and gauntleted,
riding forth with his dusty troopers clattering
behind to do the ungentle deeds that somehow
have always filled the mind of the gentler sex with
a sentimental pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Ah must tell yo&rsquo; abaout his
being o&rsquo;dehed to proceed along the South Fo&rsquo;k
of the&mdash;something-oah-othah&mdash;Ah must write
to-day and get the name of that rivah&mdash;all hidden
by cottonwoods along its banks, just lak in the
books, yo&rsquo; know&mdash;and destroy all Piegan Indians.
He was a shavetail then, and didn&rsquo;t know a Piegan
Indian from a Sioux, and he nea&rsquo;ly brought on a
wah. If it hadn&rsquo;t been fo&rsquo; his old first se&rsquo;geant&mdash;Oh,
his men all love him, Ah know&mdash;eve&rsquo;ybody
does!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so she flowed on, while Emily sat and listened
with the mellowed smile of an indulgence
almost motherly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we ah going to live in Washington at first,
he&rsquo;s General&mdash;What&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s aide now, yo&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>know. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s allowed to weah aiguillettes;
Ah must show them to yo&rsquo; in his photograph.
But when he&rsquo;s changed, we&rsquo;ll probably
have to go to some weste&rsquo;n post. Think of mah
living aout theah&mdash;an ahmy woman! Ah&rsquo;ll have
an Indian to cook fo&rsquo; us, and yo&rsquo; and Je&mdash;Mistuh
Gahwood must come aout and visit us. He can get
himself appointed on a committee to inspect ahmy
posts, yo&rsquo; know, yo&rsquo; all can save lots of money
that way. Ah&rsquo;ve grown economical since Ah&rsquo;m
going to mah&rsquo;y an ahmy officeh. They get awfully
small salaries; it&rsquo;s a shame. But Mistuh Gahwood
can have himself put on the committee&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Washington has corrupted you,
Dade,&rdquo; said Emily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Corrupted me?&rdquo; the girl repeated. &ldquo;Co&rsquo;se it
has, it corrupts eve&rsquo;ybody. That&rsquo;s what eve&rsquo;ybody
does down theah. It&rsquo;s all pull&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way
Ahthu&rsquo; got his detail as aide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily&rsquo;s face had lost its smile, and had sobered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she breathed with a sigh. &ldquo;Did you see
Jerome there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dade looked at Emily questioningly an instant,
and then she hastened to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How stupid of me! To sit heah and talk of
Ahthu&rsquo; when Ah ought to have known that yo&rsquo;
all weh dying to heah abaout yoah husband. Oh,
yes, Ah saw him at a distance a numbah of times,
and one day Ah met him in the rotunda of the
Capitol. We weh in the gallery, Ahthu&rsquo; and Ah,
and had heahd him make a speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily had leaned forward a little; her lips were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>parted, and her teeth showed in the first smile of
real interest she had displayed. She laid her hand
lightly on Dade&rsquo;s arm, finding it a comfort to touch
some one who had been there in Washington,
some one who had seen him in his proper place,
some one who had heard him speak, who had
spoken to him and touched his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What speech was it, Dade?&rdquo; she asked, eagerly.
&ldquo;The one in the tariff debate, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness me&rsquo;cy me!&rdquo; ejaculated Dade. &ldquo;Ah
don&rsquo;t know what it was on&mdash;yo&rsquo; can&rsquo;t tell a wo&rsquo;d
they say, they all make so much noise. Ahthu&rsquo;
said it was lak a sun dance of the Ogallalla Sioux.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, how did he look?&rdquo; Emily&rsquo;s eyes were
glistening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked splendid, Emily, splendid. He rose,
yo&rsquo; know, suddenly, and began to speak befo&rsquo; Ah
knew it was he at all. And he grew excited, and
all the othahs crowded in to heah&mdash;it must have
been a great speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily made Dade tell her all she could recall
out of her scattered memories of that scene, and
the glow in her eyes mingled all the love she had
borne him, all the hopes she had cherished, and
all the high envy of Dade, to whom it had been
given to be there and behold that scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is he looking, tell me that?&rdquo; asked
Emily when Dade had told her at last that she
could think of no more to tell.</p>

<p>Dade turned toward her as if she had an unpleasant
revelation to make, and said, hesitatingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Emily&mdash;he&rsquo;s grown fat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought of the trim, narrow-waisted figure
of her own brown soldier lover. But Emily only
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;Mother Garwood says his
father filled out at his age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Dade resumed her celebration of Beck
once more, and described for Emily the glories
of the Army and Navy ball. And when she had
done, she sat, her chin on her little white fist, and
looked dreamily out of the open window into the
cool green foliage of the trees, where some robins
were building a nest. Emily likewise fell into
reverie, and they sat there a long time before the
reverie was broken. It was Dade at last who said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emily, ah mah&rsquo;ied people happieh than single
people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The childishness of the question was lost upon
Emily, whose thoughts had been busy with the
unpleasant task of contrasting her own girlhood&rsquo;s
dreams and their fulfilment with the dreams of
Dade and their promise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said in reply. Her voice was a mere
hollow note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah yo&rsquo; all happy?&rdquo; said Dade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; Emily answered. Her voice was still
pitched on that hollow note.</p>

<p>Dade turned her head and looked at Emily. She
saw her great eyes blinking, the tears brimming
to their long lashes. She looked and wondered,
looked as long as she dared. And the wide, wide
distance between them she did not try to span by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>any words, but together they sat, and pondered
on the great thing that had come into their lives,
as it comes into all lives, with its hope and its frustration
of hope, its joy and its death of joy, its
peace and its tragedy.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="III-VI">VI</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH it was still early in May, though
the business of the nation was pressing for
attention, though the reforms promised by
the party in power had not been brought to pass,
and though two months must elapse before the
candidates for the presidency could be nominated,
six before a president could be elected, and nearly
a year before he could be inducted into office, the
coming national conventions already wrought a
curious effect in the nation.</p>

<p>In the first place, that strange artificial thing
which men call business felt a peculiar numbing
influence stealing over it. Men began to move
cautiously, to speak guardedly, to control their
opinions. They grew crafty and secretive, as if the
trend of events depended on what, in the next few
months, they said or did. The great question, of
course, was not what should be done to make the
people better and happier, though there was abundant
pretense that this was so, but who should get
hold of the offices, for only so far as the holding of
offices and the drawing of salaries could make men
and those dependent upon them happier, did this
question of the joy of humanity enter into the calculations
of men.</p>

<p>Those already in office sighed as they thought of
the rapidity with which their terms had rolled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>around and wondered how they might stay in. The
greater army of those who had been out of office,
and for whom the time had dragged so slowly by,
were wondering how to get in. To succeed in
either case it was not necessary that men should
have programs of reform and progress, or to have
any real understanding of the theories of government,
it was only necessary for them to say that
they belonged to one or the other of two great
parties into which the people had arbitrarily divided
themselves, and to be able to control, somehow,
other men in the casting of their votes.</p>

<p>There were, of course, two or three other parties,
small and without hope of success, so that the men
who belonged to them could honestly say what
they thought, but it was not considered respectable
or dignified to belong to any of these smaller parties,
and the men who adhered to them were ridiculed
and ostracized and made to feel ashamed.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Washington, where all depend in
some way upon the Government, in the cloak rooms
of the two houses of Congress, in the rotundas and
lobbies of hotels, in the clubs and bar-rooms, in
drawing rooms and parlors, and in the secret chambers
of the White House itself, men talked of nothing
but these national conventions. In Congress
business was dragging. The usual daily sessions
were held, and perfervid speeches were delivered,
but there was no legislation, which was perhaps
just as well. Both parties feared just then the
possible effect legislation might have on the voters,
and each sought to put the other in an unpopular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>attitude before the people. In a word, as the correspondents
wrote in the lengthened specials they
wired to their newspapers each night, the politicians
at Washington were playing politics.</p>

<p>To Garwood, however, this life was full and
satisfying. To saunter over to the House at noon,
to saunter back, to lean at the corner of the little
bar in the Arlington, one foot cocked over the
other, his broad hat on the back of his head, and
the Havana cigar between his teeth tilted at an
angle parallel with the line of his hat brim, thus
preserving to the eye the symmetry of the whole
striking picture he knew he made&mdash;this was existence
for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be on yoah state delegation to the national
convention, I take it, suh?&rdquo; Colonel Bird
would say to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Garwood would reply, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet
whether I&rsquo;ll go on at large or not. It&rsquo;ll all depend
on the situation when we get down to Springfield.
Unless the boys feel that I could do more good
somewhere else, I&rsquo;ll go on. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll go from
the district.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll be theah, I&rsquo;m suah, suh. Boy&mdash;make
us anothah of those mint juleps. And, boy!&mdash;if
you will allow me, suh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the colonel bowed
in his courtly old-school way to Garwood&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t
mash the mint this time, just pinch the sprigs, oah
twis&rsquo; them, so as to avoid the bittah flavah you
othahwise impaht to yoah concoction. I find it ve&rsquo;y
difficult, Colonel,&rdquo; the old gentleman continued,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>turning to Garwood, &ldquo;to get a julep made prope&rsquo;ly
out of Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It pleased Garwood to be addressed as colonel,
as it pleases any man, and he was conscious of a
momentary regret that he had not induced Colonel
Warfield to ask the governor of Illinois to appoint
him as an aide-de-camp on his staff, so that the
title might be his. He resolved to have that done
if&mdash;but his mind darkened at the prospect of all he
must suffer and endure before his political fortunes
could again be considered secure. Another
campaign with all its uncertainty lay before him,
and there was no Rankin any more to lean on.
He preferred to close his eyes to the future, and
to live to the full the happy moments that flew
by so swiftly.</p>

<p>The colonel had insisted on their seating themselves
at one of the two or three small tables in
the little bar-room, so that he might sip his julep
in the lazy deliberation so dear to his Southern
nature, and as they sat there, other members
dropped in, and were invited by the colonel with
a hospitable wave of his white hand to join them.</p>

<p>They were all glad to do so, for Colonel Bird represented
one of those Kentucky districts dear to
the congressional heart, which not only afforded
a romantic background for his own picturesque figure,
but possessed a higher attribute in this, that
it always returned the colonel to Washington without
contest or question. He was never troubled
about renomination or relection. He had been
speaking of that district for years&mdash;ever since he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>had accepted the benefits of the amnesty proclamation,
which he affected to despise&mdash;with a calm
proprietary air that filled the souls of the men
gathered about him in the afternoon of this warm
spring day, with a longing far above all the other
longings of spring.</p>

<p>The colonel had laid off his planter&rsquo;s hat, and
with his paunch pressed against the table, sat and
tinkled the ice in his tall glass as if he loved its
cool music, and awaited the serving of the others
whom he had invited to become of his party. He
sat erectly, as his paunch forced him to do, and
now and then, in a way that added to his dignity,
stroked the mustaches and imperial that were white
as cotton against his red face. But his relief was
apparent when at last the bartender brought the
fragrant glasses with their cool crystal reflecting
the green of the little sprigs of mint, and then he
bowed, as well as he could, and formally awaited
the pleasure of his guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; said Ladd, of Colorado, in the big western
voice that so heartily expressed the amenity
that all felt due the occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suhs,&rdquo; replied the colonel, &ldquo;yoah ve&rsquo;y good
health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel took a long pull at the straw, and
then straightening himself, sat, warm and red and
pompous, the glossy bosom of his shirt arching
itself to meet his imperial as though it would do
its best to replace the starched frills that his antebellum
personality lacked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Colonel, whom are you Democrats going
to nominate?&rdquo; asked Van Beek, of New York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suh,&rdquo; the colonel began, speaking gravely
and with much consideration, as if he were indeed
to deliver the judgment of his party&rsquo;s convention.
&ldquo;Pehsonally, I&rsquo;d like to see a Southe&rsquo;n gentleman,
of cou&rsquo;se. But that reminds me of an old friend
of mine, who came down to see me &rsquo;long in the
spring of seventy-six to ask that same question,
suh. You all remembah that the&rsquo; was a good deal
of discussion goin&rsquo; on in ouah pahty that yeah
about ouah p&rsquo;ospective candidate. The friend to
whom I refeh was an old fellah who lived neah
mah place, and he always came ovah to see me
whenevah I got home f&rsquo;om Washington, in o&rsquo;deh
to discuss the political issues of the day. I received
him, and we sat down on the po&rsquo;ch, and aftah I&rsquo;d
called mah house niggah to make us some juleps&mdash;I
wish, suhs, we had those juleps heah to-day,
though I do not wish to dispa&rsquo;age the liquah ouah
landlo&rsquo;d se&rsquo;ves heah, not at all, suhs.&rdquo; He inclined
his head apologetically toward the bar. &ldquo;I had
known this old man fo&rsquo; a long pe&rsquo;iod of tahm. He
was a po&rsquo; fahmah, but&mdash;he rode in mah troop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel paused again, that the company
might have time to appreciate the paternal relation
of officer and man who had ridden with Morgan&rsquo;s
Raiders, and then went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rehea&rsquo;sed the names of seve&rsquo;al of the distinguished
gentlemen whose names had been brought
fo&rsquo;wahd by theah friends fo&rsquo; the high office. The&rsquo;
was Tilden, and Seymoah, and Bayahd, and Thu&rsquo;man,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>and othahs you&rsquo;ll remembuh, but none of
them seemed somehow to impress the ol&rsquo; fellah
favo&rsquo;ably. No, suh, none of the names seemed
to impress the ol&rsquo; fellah favo&rsquo;ably, till at las&rsquo;, I
added: &lsquo;And then, theah&rsquo;s some mention of Davis,&rsquo;
meaning the distinguished ju&rsquo;ist of yoah state,
suh,&rdquo; the colonel explained, bowing to Garwood,
who, as if expressly deputed thereto by the governor
of Illinois, bowed the acknowledgment that
seemed to be due the honor thus conferred upon
that commonwealth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the magic name of Davis, the po&rsquo; ol&rsquo; man&rsquo;s
eyes lit up with Promethean fiah,&rdquo; the colonel continued,
his own little eyes sparkling, &ldquo;and, leaning
fo&rsquo;wahd, trembling like an aspen leaf, with the
delight he was almost afraid to indulge, he looked
cahfully all about him, and took his long seegah
from his lips, and then he whispehed: &lsquo;But, Colonel,
ain&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; all afeahed it&rsquo;s a <i>leetle</i> airly?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, suhs,&rdquo; the colonel resumed, having
bent his purple face to sip his julep and to give
his companions opportunity to pay his story the
tribute of the laugh he demanded, &ldquo;I feah in this
instance, suhs, it&rsquo;s a <i>leetle airly</i> fo&rsquo; a Southron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, se&rsquo;iously, suhs,&rdquo; the colonel went on, after
a proper pause, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; back to Kentucky the
end of this month. I&rsquo;ll go ovah to Frankfo&rsquo;t, and
I&rsquo;ll go to the Capitol Hotel, and theah I&rsquo;ll meet
the friends of mah own state, and aftah that, I&rsquo;ll
have some idea of whom I shall suppoht when we
all get up to Chicago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like to get over to Frankfort, don&rsquo;t you, Colonel?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>asked Conley of Ohio, in the bald way that
men had of inducing the colonel to talk about Kentucky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suh, yes, suh, in a ce&rsquo;tain sense I dew.
It&rsquo;s ve&rsquo;y pleasant to&rsquo; a gentleman to meet all his
old friends and comrades in ahms, as I do theah,
but I will say this, suhs, that theah is at Frankfo&rsquo;t
an aggregation of men who seemingly fo&rsquo; ages
have been hanging onto the public teat theah,
suhs, and who, if the good Lawd would see fit
to snatch them to his bosom, would be the subjects
of a special dispensation of divahn Providence
in which I could acquiesce, suhs, with an
enthusiasm that would be tuhbulent and even riotous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this the colonel, feeling that politeness
demanded the elimination of himself from his conversation,
temporarily at least, turned to Garwood
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got a contes&rsquo; on in yoah district this
yeah, Colonel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always have had,&rdquo; said Garwood, and a sudden
rueful expression overspread his countenance,
&ldquo;and I know no reason to expect any change in the
ordinary routine this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suh. I wish I weh at liberty to go into
yoah district this fall and make some speeches fo&rsquo;
you,&rdquo; said the colonel, with that nave conceit of
his which led him to feel that his presence would
save the day for Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could go out there <i>now</i>, with your gun,
and in approved Kentucky style, kill off a few men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>I could name, I would like it almost as well,&rdquo; Garwood
replied.</p>

<p>The colonel made no answer to this. But he
looked a stern rebuke at Garwood, as at one who
trifled with grave and serious matters.</p>

<p>They sat there and drank and listened to the
colonel&rsquo;s stories until the evening came, until the
night itself had fallen. And then Garwood received
Pusey&rsquo;s telegram, and it smote him dumb in the
middle of a laugh. He had only time to ask Colonel
Bird to request a leave of absence for him,
before he hurried away to pack his bag. The colonel
was delighted, of course, to have the opportunity
to act for a friend in any matter. In fact,
nothing could please him more than to be enabled
to rise in his place in the House in all that morning
dignity which no dissipation of the previous night
could impair, and address the Speaker. And it
may have been merely to show his appreciation of
the confidence thus reposed in him, that he went
with Garwood to see him safely aboard his train,
on which he was to speed westward, with troubled
mind, through the mountains and over the plains,
out to Illinois.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ARWOOD&rsquo;S train, like most trains that go
through Grand Prairie, was late that evening,
and the white twilight upon which
Emily had depended for protection as she waited
at the station, had deepened to a gloom that almost
absorbed her little figure, clad in the black of
her mourning garb, though the little toque and
jacket she wore were of a vernal fashion that lent
a smartness to her attire. She had determined to
spend the half hour she had to wait beyond the
moment scheduled for the train&rsquo;s arrival, in fancying
herself again in her husband&rsquo;s arms, and in
imagining his joy at being once more at home with
her, but the memories of her last visit to this station
on that rainy December night long ago, when she
had reached home from her broken visit to Washington,
would crowd in upon her, and torture her,
setting in train thoughts that assailed her resolute
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>The station agent had begun by energetically
chalking on the blackboard that was nailed under
the wide eaves of the little chalet that did for a
station, the number of minutes the train was
late. When that time fled by, and the train did
not come, he rubbed out his first figures and
chalked in others; when the minutes these inadequately
symboled had gone by like the rest, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>gave over the effort and flatly told Emily, with
a helpless gesture that spoke his refusal to be
any longer responsible, that he did not know when
the train would come. He glanced at the lights on
his semaphore, and then shut himself into his little
ticket office, where the telegraph instrument,
ticking feverishly away, indicated some remaining
spark of life in the railroad&rsquo;s system.</p>

<p>Emily had been worrying for some time about all
the possible things that might happen to the baby
during her absence. She had been worrying about
the dinner she had ordered in place of their usual
supper, but that, she was sure, had long ago grown
cold, and was beyond reach even of a woman&rsquo;s
worry.</p>

<p>The train came at last, when every one about the
station had collapsed into an attitude of having
given it up entirely, and Emily forgot her long
wait in the joy with which she rushed forth to
greet her husband. She saw his big figure emerging
from the last coach on the train. His hat was
pulled down to his brows, and he looked out upon
the desolate scene that the little station presents to
the traveler who enters Grand Prairie by that road,
with the crossness of a passenger whose train with
almost human perversity had been losing time ever
since it started. When he saw Emily he did not
quicken his pace, though he walked on in her direction,
with a long face that told her he was entitled
to her pity and sympathy for all that he had to
endure in life. She ran toward him, and he bent
his head that she might embrace his neck and kiss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>him. She clung there an instant, and when she
released him his eyes were searching the barren
platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody else here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, dear&mdash;who would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Pusey here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pusey?&rdquo; she repeated, in surprise. But Garwood
made no answer. He was thinking of the
old days when he was always met by Rankin, and
usually by half a dozen of Rankin&rsquo;s followers gathered
together to give <i>clat</i> to the congressman&rsquo;s
home-coming. But now there was no one to meet
him but Emily.</p>

<p>He insisted upon a carriage to be driven home
in, saying the ride from Olney in the common
coach had nearly killed him, and when, above the
rattle of the old hack&rsquo;s windows, Emily said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to have you home again,&rdquo; her last
words somehow expressed the whole situation
against which his nature was in revolt, and he
cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, home again! Nice time to be called away
from Washington! What are they all trying to do
here now, do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They seem,&rdquo; Emily replied, &ldquo;to be trying to
defeat you for a third term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I sometimes wish they&rsquo;d succeed,&rdquo; said
Garwood; &ldquo;sometimes I get sick of this whole
business of politics, and wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily was sitting upright, her face turned away
from him in her disappointment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; she acquiesced, in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Garwood growled, as if she and not he
himself had suggested the very disaster which of
all others he most feared, &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t beat me this
time, I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em that. I reckon Jim Rankin&rsquo;s at
the bottom of it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE curtains were drawn at the windows of
Garwood&rsquo;s law office that night, but the thin
lip of light that outlined the casement told to
belated men in Grand Prairie that a conference was
going on within. The primaries were but two days
off, and a vague uncertain quality in the rays that
straggled into the gloom and lightened the rusty
gilt letters of Garwood&rsquo;s sign, creaking as it had
done for so many years in the wind, might have
hinted to the imaginative something of the straits
in which the little council gathered within found
itself.</p>

<p>Had such a one been acquainted with politics in
that prairie district, and had seen Jim Rankin pass
by at midnight under the trees that swayed the
thick black shadows of their foliage dizzily to and
fro on the wide stone sidewalk, and noted the
curious smile that glimmered an instant on Rankin&rsquo;s
face, when from force of old habit he raised an
upward glance, he would have concluded that serious
obstacles beset the way of Jerome B. Garwood
in that career to which as a man of destiny he had
believed himself ordained, and from which the inconstant
and ever-changing circle of his friends
had expected so much.</p>

<p>Garwood had come home to find his political
condition desperate. He himself, out of the anger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>that showed black in his face during those hot and
trying days, described the situation as a revolt and,
had he been possessed of the power, would gladly
have punished the rebels by such stern repressive
measures as autocratic governments employ in the
terror their inherent weakness inspires.</p>

<p>Amid the spring delights of Washington public
life he had become swollen with new ambitions. He
not only wished to be renominated for Congress,
but he wished also to be placed at the head of the
Polk County delegation to the state convention
called to meet in Springfield early in June; and
beyond this, he had the higher wish to be sent
as delegate to the national convention at Chicago.
He would have preferred, of course, to be named
as one of the Big Four delegates at large from Illinois,
and when his imagination had been more
warmly stimulated by Colonel Bird&rsquo;s mint juleps,
he had dramatized himself as electrifying the national
convention by some fine extemporaneous
flight of oratory, in which he should soar in an
instant to the pinnacle of a national fame, and from
that rare altitude behold new and illimitable possibilities
of political future. It was, therefore, with
a shock of disappointment to which he had not
the power to reconcile himself that he had obeyed
Pusey&rsquo;s urgent telegram and had come home to
find his very political existence at stake.</p>

<p>Sprague, reviled and reproached as a perennial
candidate by those in the district who were themselves
perennial candidates, was once more in the
field seeking congressional honors. His county,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>Moultrie, had held its convention, and once more
instructed its fifteen delegates for him. Over in
Logan, General Barrett, having had a glimpse of
the promised land at the Pekin convention, had
so far departed from the reserve and dignity of
his eminent respectability as to have himself declared
a candidate, and he had been indorsed by
his county. These candidatures did not seriously
alarm Garwood, but a new complication had been
suddenly added to the situation of such grave portent
that he had summoned about him those who,
having received government offices of varying degrees
of importance, still felt themselves bound to
his support.</p>

<p>This night, then, they were gathered in the office
where Enright now spent his days in the midst of a
law practice so immature and modest that it could
not keep the dust off the books that were piled all
about. Pusey was there and Hale had hurried over
from Pekin on receipt of a telegram from Garwood.
Beside these were Kellogg, whom Garwood
had succeeded in placing in the office of the secretary
of state at Springfield, and Crawford, his private
secretary. They were ranged on chairs uniformly
tilted against the wall of the little private
office, and the air was streaked with the customary
clouds of tobacco smoke that indicate a political
fire.</p>

<p>Hale lowered his chair to the floor, and bent
over with his elbows on his knees, his head hanging
and his face hidden. The others in the room,
except Pusey, who was as indifferent as ever, had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>transfixed him with accusing eyes, though any one
could have told that their attitude was feigned in
order to keep in sympathy with the threatening
mood of Garwood, who sat at his desk, and glowered
at the Pekin postmaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo; demanded Garwood
presently, as if Hale had been arraigned upon an
indictment, and they were waiting for him to enter
a plea.</p>

<p>Hale stirred uneasily, but he did not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Garwood, petulantly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see why you couldn&rsquo;t have held Tazewell, anyhow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Mr. Garwood,&rdquo; said Hale,
at length, breaking under the pressure of all those
accusing stares, &ldquo;you see, it&rsquo;s like this. The people
over our way are sore on the president, they&rsquo;re
down on the administration&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; cried Garwood, striking his desk in
disgust, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a damn for what the people
think about the president, or the administration.
I ain&rsquo;t the president, nor the administration,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they think you&rsquo;re supportin&rsquo; the administration&mdash;course,&rdquo;&mdash;Hale
hastened to disclaim any
individual responsibility for so serious a charge&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
only tellin&rsquo; you what they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t any of them read my speech the
other day? Does that look as if I&rsquo;m supporting
the administration?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hale had no reply to make to this argument. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>only heaved his heavy shoulders in something that
approximated a shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was Bailey over there?&rdquo; Garwood demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s been over off an&rsquo; on for a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why in hell didn&rsquo;t you write me!&rdquo; said
Garwood, turning angrily in his chair. His eyes
blazed at Hale a moment, and then he tossed his
head and looked away in utter disgust.</p>

<p>Hale had thrown him a glance that in its turn
had some of the anger that was beginning to show
in his reddening face, and he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know it, that&rsquo;s why. You can&rsquo;t
get on to Zeph Bailey; he wades in the water, he
does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hale breathed hard, and no one had an answer
ready. They all knew Bailey&rsquo;s mysterious habits,
and Hale&rsquo;s explanation was sufficient to acquit
him in the forum of their minds. Hale sensed instantly
a new and defensive quality in the atmosphere;
a current of sympathy seemed to set in
toward him, and he kept on, feeling his advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t any of the rest of you wise guys
get on to him when he come over and started to fix
things right here in Polk County?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they had no answer for that. Garwood,
sweeping the circle with a glance, and fearing a
division in his own ranks, forced a smile of conciliation,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if Bailey&rsquo;s a candidate, we&rsquo;ll have to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>fight him, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s only one more, anyway,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the menace of Bailey&rsquo;s candidacy had cast
upon his spirits a shadow too dense to be lightened
by mere words, and his sentence died with
the confident air he had been able for a moment
to command. Hale, however, had been mollified,
and took Garwood&rsquo;s manner from him, as he
straightened up to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Course, we&rsquo;ll make a fight for it. You&rsquo;ve got
some friends left in Tazewell, and so have I, and
if we&rsquo;re licked, we&rsquo;ll die with our boots on, that&rsquo;s
all there is to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has his own county, of course. And you
say he has men at work up in DeWitt. Now, if
he gets Tazewell and Polk&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Garwood
flung out his hands hopelessly, as if to surrender.
&ldquo;Great guns, what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Sprague&rsquo;ll throw Moultrie to him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
fixed. Sprague knows he can&rsquo;t get it; he&rsquo;s just
been acting as a stalking horse for Bailey,&rdquo; said
Kellogg, anxious to bear his part in this conference,
even if he could bring nothing cheerful to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did he ever get on the blind side of
Sprague?&rdquo; queried Garwood, peevishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, legislature,&rdquo; said Kellogg, proud to be able
to show his knowledge of affairs in the state house
at Springfield; &ldquo;he put some of Sprague&rsquo;s fellows&mdash;Simp
Lewis and some more of &rsquo;em&mdash;on the pay
roll, and took care of brother-in-law Wilson when
he made up the committees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-m-m-m,&rdquo; Garwood mused, &ldquo;Mason and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>Moultrie, and DeWitt&mdash;if he gets Tazewell or Polk
now&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what you gentlemen think
about it, but it looks to me as if he had us pretty
nearly skinned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What they thought of it was not apparent, for
none of them spoke, and silence settled over the little
room, where Garwood&rsquo;s ambitions were trembling
in the fateful balance. At last Pusey spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got Polk <i>yet</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something of the determination which the little
man had put into his tone affected the others, and
they looked up with new smiles. A reaction set
in and Garwood glanced at Pusey gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, trying to resume his congressional
dignity, with a smile that was intended to
take from it its suggestion of distance, &ldquo;you remember
what the devil said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;let us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our enemy; our own loss how repair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How overcome this dire calamity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What reinforcement we may gain from hope;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not, what resolution from despair.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p>They stared at him in amazement, wondering
how it was possible for him to know what the
devil had said, all except Pusey, who nodded appreciatively,
to show his own relation to the world
of letters. And then Hale drew a long breath and
threw back his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if we can carry the primaries
here in Polk, that will help us to win out over
in my county. Can you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Jim Rankin?&rdquo; blurted out the tactless,
maladroit Kellogg. The name cast a chill
over the little gathering just as the new cheer was
warming it, and they were all vicariously embarrassed
by what, just at that time, amounted to a
<i>contretemps</i>. If Rankin himself, passing by outside
at that very moment, could have seen the expressive
glances that were secretly exchanged
before they all yielded to the impulse to fix unitedly
on Garwood&rsquo;s face, he would have had a sensation
to gladden him during all his homeward way. But
Garwood met the situation with real dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim will be against me, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They might have demurred out of mere politeness,
but Garwood added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can assure you, gentlemen, he is an antagonist
not to be despised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mention of Rankin&rsquo;s name, however, had the
final effect of forcing them to seek some positive
means of dealing with the situation, and after the
preliminary waste of time common to most conferences,
they began at last to plan for the coming
primaries. They were at it a long while, and when
in the chill, ghastly hours of the early morning
they separated, Garwood voiced what was doubtless
in the hearts of all of them, when he said to
Pusey:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, we have Jim Rankin to fight,
Pusey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pusey switched his little eyes toward Garwood,
but Garwood did not see them. He was thinking
of other days.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ARWOOD awoke after a few hours of restless
sleep, snatched a hurried breakfast, seized
his hat and was going away without a word,
when Emily followed him through the hall and to
the door, and with nervousness and suspense showing
in her concentrated brows she looked up at
him and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad when this day&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;ll I,&rdquo; he rejoined, and then, though he had
stepped on the veranda, he turned again. A sudden
tenderness, springing from the need of support
and sympathy he himself felt that day, overflowed
his heart, and he pressed his fingers to her brow
and touched the wrinkles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see those there,&rdquo; he said, and as
if in instant response to his whim, her smile
smoothed them away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll send me word, Jerome, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;the babies and I&rsquo;ll be watching and waiting,
you know. Oh, I <i>wish</i> we could help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled his old smile at her loyalty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good by,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep you posted.&rdquo; And
he ran down the steps. The rain was slanting
down to make an ideal primary day, and Garwood
was glad of the waiting carriage which, in the extravagance
a man can always justify to himself in
the midst of a campaign, he had ordered the night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>before. Emily watched him drive away, down the
streaming street. Once he turned and looked back
through the window at her, or she thought he did,
and she waved her hand.</p>

<p>Then all the morning long she went about the
house with the memory of his kiss upon her lips,
and she sang at times, though her heart would
forever leap into her throat when she thought of
the bitter contest going on in the rain that was
falling upon the green fields of Polk County. The
rain fell steadily in the gloom with an impressiveness
that would remind her of the silent fate which
that day was deciding Jerome&rsquo;s future and her own.</p>

<p>She felt as if she were passing through a crisis
in her life. She found it impossible to apply herself
steadily to any one of the futile little tasks
that are always awaiting the hand of the housewife,
but wandered aimlessly about, unable to rest, unable
to work, unable to do anything until she
knew the event of that day. She had found a new
faith in Jerome with the kiss he had given her at
parting, and she lived over and over again that
one last moment when he had smiled down into her
eyes with the expression she remembered of other
days. That moment and that kiss were enough to
blot out all the years of her loneliness and renunciation,
and as those years faded from her view she
could look forward now with a new hope and a new
confidence to the happier days she felt must come
when this last battle had been fought. For she
felt it would be the last battle; she determined that
it must be the last battle; she could not endure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>the strain and suspense of another, and her soul&rsquo;s
sincere desire took the romantic form of a prayer
that Jerome return to her bearing his shield or being
borne upon it.</p>

<p>The rain had come with a thunder storm early in
the morning, but as the day advanced the temperature
lowered and a cold, raw wind blowing from
the west lashed out the last of the warm weather
they had been having all over central Illinois. The
hope of the spring seemed suddenly gone; the day,
indeed, might have belonged to that dreary season
of the fall, when gray clouds hang low and children
long for the darkness that will bring the needed
cheer of early lamp-light.</p>

<p>The streets were silent and deserted. Now and
then, perhaps some grocer&rsquo;s wagon would lurch
along, its driver slapping the streaming rubber
blanket on his horse&rsquo;s back with his wet reins, and
sometimes one of the town&rsquo;s tattered old hacks
would rattle by. Here and there, near some cobbler&rsquo;s
shanty, or by the door of a little barber shop,
ward workers huddled in shivering groups, and
every little while men drove out of town in buggies
or buckboards, to look after the caucuses that were
to be held that afternoon in the townships; but
the people themselves, as their habit ever was, in
Grand Prairie, evinced little interest in the political
contest at this critical stage of its development, and
seemed to be indoors waiting for the rain to cease.</p>

<p>Yet a great battle was raging in Grand Prairie
that day, and Garwood&rsquo;s law offices were once more
serving as political headquarters. All morning long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>the crowd of workers whom he had enrolled in his
new organization thronged the outer office, each
of them wishing to seize Garwood a moment for
himself, as if his suggestion, or his complaint, or
the news he bore was such that Garwood himself
alone should hear it.</p>

<p>Their clothes were soaked with the rain, their
wet boots tracked the floor with mud, their umbrellas
trickled little streams of dirty water. The
air, already saturated with heavy moisture and
foggy with the smoke of tobacco, which does for
the smoke of battle in these political contests, was
foul with the fumes of beer and whisky, while the
whiff of an onion now and then brought to mind
the long saloon of Chris Steisfloss below where the
pink mosquito-netting had been removed for that
day from the free-lunch table.</p>

<p>In his private office, his rumpled hair falling to
his haggard eyes, his cravat untied, his long coat
tails gathered behind the hands that were thrust
deep in his trousers&rsquo; pockets, Garwood strode back
and forth silent and savage, chewing the cigar that
smoked away in the corner of his mouth. Pusey
was with him, tapping in and out of the room, and
so was Hale. Hale had been there all morning, for,
having no acquaintance in Grand Prairie, he could
do nothing outside, and so he sat, feeling that his
stolid, imponderable presence must somehow be a
comfort to Garwood. And, besides, he did not
know how he could decently get away.</p>

<p>Garwood spoke to neither of them; but walked
the floor and rolled his cigar round and round in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>his mouth, spitting out pieces of it now and then
savagely. Once at the end of the beat he was
pacing he paused by the revolving bookcase in
which he had kept his working library, the books
he had needed at his elbow when he was digging
into the law. These books, because of that rapid
displacement which goes on in law libraries, so
swiftly do the appellate courts grind out new decisions,
were now out of date; the statutes were
two sessions behind the Legislature, the digest had
been superseded by a new edition, the last six
numbers of his set of the reports were missing.</p>

<p>But he did not observe these things&mdash;a little
volume had caught his eye, and he picked it
up, blew the dust from it, and opened it. And as
his glance fell on its pages, its well-read remembered
pages, his face softened and there passed
across its darkness the faint reflection of a smile.
It was not a law book, for Garwood held it tenderly
in his hand, as though he loved it, and men
do not learn to love law books. It was a little
leather covered copy of Epictetus, with the imprint
of a London publisher on its title page, one that
Emily had given him, and he had read it through
and through, and it bore many loving marks on its
margins.</p>

<p>It had lain there on that bookcase, possibly untouched,
certainly unopened for years. He must
have tossed it down there before his first campaign&mdash;how
long ago that seemed! He turned
over the pages and here and there he saw a marked
passage, words that once had thrilled him, more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>than that, words that had comforted him, but now
they were cold and dead, they no longer had any
meaning or any message for him; he wondered for
a moment why it was so. But his mind could not
long desert its hard pressed post that day, and if
for an instant he yearned for some of the peace of
the days that little book somehow stood for, he
tossed it back where it had lain so long, brushed
his fingers together to fleck the dust from them,
and resumed his pacing.</p>

<p>Noon came, the clock in the high school tower
struck, the bell in the fire engine house tapped, the
whistle at the woolen mills blew. The outer office
was deserted, Pusey had left an hour before, and
when Crawford and Hale suggested luncheon to
Garwood, he shook his head so petulantly that they
were glad enough to go out and leave him alone.
When they had gone, he sank into his chair,
sprawled his long legs out before him, and sat there
scowling darkly.</p>

<p>He sat there a long while, but finally he roused,
got up, opened the ugly walnut cupboard in his
room, drew out a bottle and a glass and poured
out for himself a generous draft of whisky. He
drank the stuff without water, raw, and when he
had taken advantage of his brief seclusion to light
a cigarette, inhaling its smoke eagerly, he began
to pace the floor again. Two or three times after
that he stopped by the cupboard and took the
bottle down; at last he did not put it back in its
hiding place, but set it out openly on his desk.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>Now, the times he passed it without drinking were
growing fewer and fewer.</p>

<p>Hale was the first to return. Garwood had just
halted by his desk and poured himself another
drink, and he stood with his hand still on the bottle
when Hale burst into the room. The man&rsquo;s face
plainly foreboded evil tidings, and he stood and
stared at Garwood without speaking, as if he disliked
to tell him what was on his tongue. Garwood
had raised the glass, but with it at his lips he
stopped and looked up to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in hell&rsquo;s the matter with you, Hale; are
you drunk or crazy, or have you seen a ghost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen&mdash;Bailey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bailey!&rdquo; Garwood slowly lowered the glass to
the desk, as if Hale had seen something more than
a ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out on&mdash;what&rsquo;s that long street? He was with
Rankin, goin&rsquo; west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over to the woolen mills?&rdquo; Garwood asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Hale. &ldquo;You see, after Crawford
and I&rsquo;d got a bite to eat over at that restaurant
on the other side of the square&mdash;what&rsquo;s the name
of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, damn the name!&rdquo; exclaimed Garwood.
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyways, after that I went out to try an&rsquo;
do somethin&rsquo;, but about all I could do was to hire
&rsquo;bout half a dozen hobos who were goin&rsquo; through
from Chicago, and I was takin&rsquo; them down to Enright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>so&rsquo;s he could vote &rsquo;em at all the prim&rsquo;ries, you
know, and I happened to look up&mdash;and there I see
Bailey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was he doing, did you say?&rdquo; asked Garwood
with the morbid fascination the recital of
some painful fact has for the one it most concerns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was just moseyin&rsquo; along the street with
Rankin, you know that slow, splay-footed, knock-kneed
way he has of walking, don&rsquo;t you? Oh&mdash;there&rsquo;s
no doubt it&rsquo;s him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood slowly swallowed his drink, and had
just turned to speak again, when Pusey entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know Bailey&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>Pusey walked straight to the desk, and he had
lifted the bottle before he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you hear?&rdquo; Garwood asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just now. I repaired here instantly to apprise
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; said Garwood. &ldquo;Well, where in hell
are you going to repair to next to do something
about it? Where did <i>you</i> see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him at the Cassell House, and Rankin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Rankin,&rdquo; said Garwood. He ceased to
give attention to Pusey, since the climax of his tale
was already too fully known, but repeated Rankin&rsquo;s
name in a reminiscent tone not unlikely to inspire
pleasure in the breast of Rankin&rsquo;s successor,
as if one should sigh for a first wife in the presence
of the second. &ldquo;Jim Rankin,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You miss Rankin, heh?&rdquo; piped Pusey, squinting
at the drink he was pouring.</p>

<p>Garwood turned on him then, and shouted
angrily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, damn you, I do! If he were here now he&rsquo;d
have a suggestion; he&rsquo;d have some resources. What
have <i>you</i> to offer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pusey lifted the glass and even turned deliberately
to hold it more in range with the window, so
that the light could stream through it and bring out
the rich, warm colors of the liquor. And then, carefully
tilting the drink into his gullet, he put the
glass down, sucked his mustache into his mouth
to get the last lingering taste of the whisky, and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Garwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rankin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garwood took an impetuous step toward Pusey,
and then halting suddenly he stared at him in utter
amazement. Hale turned on the little editor a look
no less startled, but quickly glanced around at Garwood
to see what he would do. The anger that
had flushed Garwood&rsquo;s face slowly died out of it,
and his lips began to curl into a mordant smile that
slowly took on in turn the qualities of contempt and
pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pusey,&rdquo; he said, not at all in the tone that Hale
had expected to hear break from him, &ldquo;Pusey,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foolish?&rdquo; repeated Pusey seriously. &ldquo;Is it so
foolish, think you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Damnably foolish,&rdquo; Garwood replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; Pusey said, &ldquo;you evidently misunderstood
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Misunderstood you? Didn&rsquo;t you suggest buying
Jim Rankin? You evidently don&rsquo;t know men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I say Jim Rankin?&rdquo; answered Pusey. &ldquo;If
I did, I meant Jim Rankin&rsquo;s men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Garwood and Hale exclaimed together in
a weak, unconvinced note. Garwood looked at Pusey
more charitably, and Pusey returned the look
by one of subtlest meaning. Thus they stood
and gazed at each other for a whole minute, that
seemed, in the stillness that dripped into the room,
a whole age.</p>

<p>It was, in the end, Hale who spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to do something, turn some sort of
a trick, and do it quick. Zeph Bailey ain&rsquo;t here
for nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hale had drawn his watch from his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Garwood asked.</p>

<p>Hale looked at his watch again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two-thirty,&rdquo; he replied. He had once been a
railroader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bank closes at four,&rdquo; said Garwood. He
began slowly and hesitatingly to button his waistcoat,
and as though to occupy some irresolute moment
that awaited the formation of big issues, he
poured himself another drink, and gulped it, making
a wry face. Another moment passed while the
two men stood narrowly watching him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The polls close at seven, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know but they do,&rdquo; replied Pusey.</p>

<p>Then Garwood, with the firmness of a final decision,
put his hat on his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait here,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Then he bolted from the room.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE old ramshackle hack that had made its
stand in front of the Cassell House so long
that it had acquired the status of a local
institution, was tearing furiously out Sangamon
Avenue. The appearance of this ancient vehicle
outside its proper habitat, usually betokened some
emergency; and when Emily, with an ear keen
for omens that day, heard the rattle of its rheumatic
joints far down the street, and when she saw
it verify her impression of disaster by turning in
at the carriage gate and rolling up under the dripping
trees, she flew to the door with her face as
white as if she had seen a messenger boy coming
with a telegram.</p>

<p>When she saw the door of the hack burst open
before the hack itself could come to a stop, and
Jerome imperil his bones by leaping out between
its wheels, she was relieved to have him whole and
sound before her eyes, for she had half expected
to see his limp form borne in by careful attendants.
Her fears were partly realized when she saw his
gray face and the blue circles that lay under his
eyes, and they were expressed in the breathless
voice in which she exclaimed, as he leaped up the
steps:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerome! What is it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in here&mdash;quick,&rdquo; he said. She followed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>him at speed, imploring him to confess that he was
ill. He did not answer, but led the way in hot
haste to the sitting room, and then across that to
Emily&rsquo;s little writing desk, which stood open in the
bay window. She watched him in wonderment as he
fumbled in the breast of his coat and produced at
last a paper, which, rustling forth, he spread before
her on the desk. Then he seized a pen, plunged
it in the ink, and pushing her into the chair he had
dragged up to the desk, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here Em&mdash;sign this&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him in amazement that each moment
widened her eyes the more; looked at him
and then looked at the paper he held to the leaf of
her desk with a trembling finger. She took the
pen mechanically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, jerking out his words; &ldquo;right
there&mdash;under my name. You&rsquo;re to sign with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She noted the blaze in his eyes; the odor of tobacco
and liquor he exhaled oppressed her; she
looked from him to the paper on the desk, then back
to him again. In her bewilderment she gasped:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what is it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a note!&rdquo; he said, crossly, while his
brows gathered in his impatience. &ldquo;Sign it, quick!
I haven&rsquo;t a minute to lose! I&rsquo;ll explain it to you
afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked again into his brilliant eyes, she felt
his tainted breath upon her face, then something of
his own fever of haste caused her heart to leap, and
she put her name to the note below where Jerome
had scrawled his own. Garwood snatched up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>note and thrust it back in his pocket. Then he
turned to go. But Emily arose and caught at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerome! Dear! What is it! What has happened?
What is it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tumult of his troubled soul broke forth and
he poured it out upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for money&mdash;money&mdash;money!&rdquo; he cried, and
he smote the unstable little desk with his fist, making
it rock. &ldquo;What is everything for in these
days!&rdquo; His breath came hard and fast, the blue
crescents in which his eyes burned deepened perceptibly,
and his eyes flamed as if all the fires of all
excitement were about to leap out. In his cheeks,
now of an unusual pallor, two red spots glowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is the money for?&rdquo; she persisted, still
clinging to him as he backed away from her. &ldquo;Tell
me&mdash;won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for votes&mdash;votes&mdash;votes! Votes that I need
more to-day than I ever needed them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerome!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t say that,
don&rsquo;t talk that way! Wait&mdash;wait, dear, sit down
until you&rsquo;re calmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calmer!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Calmer! With all my
enemies at my heels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dear, I don&rsquo;t like the sound of that. It
would be better if you were beaten honorably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honorably!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Honorably! Do you
know what it would mean to me to be beaten now?
Do you know what it would mean to <i>you</i>! Do you
want to go to the poor-house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped in his mad rush of words and flung
out his jaw at her pugnaciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span></p>

<p>Emily stood trying to hold her husband&rsquo;s wild,
unsteady eyes in her own gaze for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jerome,&rdquo; she said in low, even accents,
&ldquo;it would be as bad as&mdash;as&mdash;as that story they told
of you in your first campaign!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face without relaxing took on the mockery
of a smile, then he laughed harshly. The tone of
the laugh shuddered through Emily. She had released
her hold on him, and now she took a step
backward. Her lips were parted and at last she
spoke, her words coming reluctantly from her
throat. It was scarcely above a whisper that she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that all&mdash;true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She saw the conviction in his eyes before it came
to its verification on his lips. He laughed again,
the same harsh laugh as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Of course it was true, you
poor little fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words brought a cry from her, and, clasping
her hands before her face, she turned and sank into
the chair and put her head down on the desk.</p>

<p>Garwood stared at her awhile, then took a step
toward her. He drew nearer and bent over her,
tried to draw her at last up into his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emily!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s all&mdash;I was&mdash;I
was&mdash;crazy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her head shook slowly from side to side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Go away&mdash;oh, please go
away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She burst into tears, and relinquishing his hold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>of her he drew himself up, swayed an instant, steadied
himself by the desk, and then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he left the room and the house, trying to
reclaim his dignity with the erectness with which he
took his careful steps down from the veranda and
to the waiting carriage. Then Emily heard the
hack roll away.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="III-XI">XI</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>MILY leaned at evening against the casement
of the western window in her room
upstairs. The rain had ceased, and though
the clouds were still as gray and cold as stone, the
air was becoming luminous, and from somewhere
had received a new inspiration, fresh and pure and
light. As she gazed listlessly away across the
vacant lots that lay beyond her home, she saw,
along the rounded tree tops and the chimneyed
roofs that made for her the western sky line, that
the blanket of cloud was slowly rolling back upon
itself, until at last it revealed a long, thin strip of
open sky, clear and blue as some remembered
stretch of summer sea. In the middle of this, far
over on the west side of the town, the low square
tower, built like an Italian belvedere on the Ursuline
Sisters&rsquo; Convent, was silhouetted, and below
and all around, the masses of foliage became vivid
green in the new light that fell upon them.</p>

<p>As all the world about shrank in the shades
of the coming night, the clouds deepened to a
purple, and in the slow and silent changes that
went constantly forward, their edges above were
softly tinged with ashes of roses, while below, the
reflected green of the trees changed their drab
to pink. Then there was traced for her a long,
wavy thread of glistening silver, the billowed top
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>of some white cloud floating deep in the illimitable
distances behind that opening in the sky. And then
suddenly, the sun sinking into this proscenium
illumined its infinite and glorious vistas with a flood
of golden light.</p>

<p>But it was all subconsciously that this woman
followed the varying shades and tones of color in
the sunset of grays and golds, and if by a strangely
divided intelligence she noted the physical changes
that were being wrought in the world outside her,
her thoughts within surged in a great ocean, of feeling
against the cold and desolate shore that now
bounded life for her. Otherwise, as she stood
there at the close of this fateful day, and saw the
gold grow brighter and the pink deepen to crimson,
she might easily have worked out a poetic
analogy between that little sunset, with the convent
tower to give it gloom, and her own life; she would
have done so once, and found a sweet exquisite sadness
in it, but now&mdash;a grief at last had come to her
too real and too tragic in its great reality for any
such romanticism, a grief that sounded deeper than
any tears.</p>

<p>Other griefs could be borne; they could be
voiced; they could find comfort in the ministrations
of sympathetic friends, in the consolations of
religion; more than all in the healing balm that
nature stores in the woods and fields. But here
was a grief that was the more intense because she
had so long dreaded it, known it even, though she
had fought the recognition off, and never admitted
it to herself before. She saw all that now, and it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>made clear so many little passages in her later life;
passages that had been dark to her, and filled with
vague troubles.</p>

<p>Here was a grief that was no new thing, but
an old thing, that had been there all the time,
like some fatal disease; she had felt its pains
and it had put its restraints and its limitations and
its renunciations upon her; now it had been correctly
diagnosed at last, that was all; and it could
not be changed, nor cured, nor alleviated even; but
she must bear it alone and in silence, walking
straight-lipped and dry-eyed the long way that
stretched before.</p>

<p>In some such mode as this her thoughts had been
rushing on ever since that moment downstairs in
the afternoon when the whole truth had been at
last revealed to her. She had thought it out along
every line she could trace; she had analyzed and
synthesized; she had viewed it from every possible
standpoint; she had built up elaborate schemes of
repair, of rehabilitation; she had planned a new life
to be begun when the wreck of the old had been
cleared away by forgiveness and new resolve; but
in the end, it had all come to the same remorseless
conviction&mdash;her faith had been destroyed, it lay
dead at her feet; nothing could ever change that
fact any more.</p>

<p>The colors were slowly dying out of the narrow
strip of sky along the horizon and it had become
opalescent and serene with evening. A new life
seemed suddenly to awake in the world below her.
A robin, that should have been in bed, went springing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>across the yard, swelling its red breast, and
Emily was vaguely conscious of wondering if it
were the one she had heard that afternoon singing
in the rain. Something moved her to raise the window,
something in the new and vital pulse that
thrilled the world.</p>

<p>With the inrushing air came the sickening odor
of the late-flowering locust tree, and there were
borne to her as well the gentle sounds of evening,
the endless trilling of insects in the wet grass; the
lowing of a cow; by and by the belated crow of
some rooster. The world was alive and awake;
it seemed to be stretching itself after its long
prostration in the rain, and now it enjoyed this
breath of keen air before it went to sleep, impatient
for the hopeful morning when it might take
up once more its glad ambitious life. But for her&mdash;so
Emily&rsquo;s thoughts ran&mdash;there was no hope and
no to-morrow.</p>

<p>The sun had trailed the last of his splendors
across that narrow opening in the sky. The opalescence
swam into a new sea of silver, then suddenly
a bar of yellow broke it, there was a rush of
violet, then purple shadows dissolved the convent
tower and the sky closed, cold and dark and still.
And there came into Emily&rsquo;s mind the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s night begins: let him never come back to us!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There would be doubt, hesitation, and pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forced praise on our part&mdash;the glimmer of twilight,</span>
<span class="i2">Never glad confident morning again!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span></p>

<p>She closed her window and turned wearily away.
She had her duties, her little duties; John Ethan
was calling, and the supper was to be laid; life
somehow after all must be lived.</p>

<p>She was going down the stairs, when suddenly
from the little habits of existence that persist sometimes
ludicrously, sometimes irritatingly, sometimes
comfortingly, even in the most tragic moments
of life, she thought of the evening papers
lying at that moment damp and limp against the
front door. The primaries&mdash;she stopped and steadied
herself by the baluster&mdash;what had been the result
of the primaries? She shook her head impatiently
for thinking of them in that moment. What
were primaries to her now? And yet&mdash;would he
win?</p>

<p>She went on down the stairs, she found the papers,
and now when the truth could no longer be
hidden, or distorted to any one&rsquo;s advantage, they
printed the truth at last&mdash;none could tell the result
at that hour; it was the hardest political battle ever
waged in Polk County, and on it hung the political
future of Jerome B. Garwood.</p>

<p>Something of the old excitement came back to
her for a moment. He was there in the thick of it,
fighting hard; he was desperate; he had risked all
again for that political future&mdash;she stopped herself
with a gasp&mdash;if, indeed, his future alone were all
that was involved! To her it was his past that was
involved; his past that meant more than all to her
now. He had, indeed, risked all upon this battle,
and all had been lost before the battle was begun!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span></p>
<p>She ate her lonely supper, she put her babies to
bed, she prolonged all her evening duties that they
might fill up her thoughts and the slow hours. Each
sound, each foot-fall on the sidewalk startled her,
and yet no one came. The evening passed. At
last she went to bed, but all the noises of the night
alarmed her, and in the darkness the burden of her
thoughts became insupportable.</p>

<p>At last she got up and went to the window that
gave a view of Sangamon Avenue and stood there
watching and listening. She went back to bed,
but sleep was far from her that night and time and
time again she rose and went to her window. Finally,
she wrapped herself in a shawl and huddled
on the floor at the low sill, and still watched and
listened. The night went by, hour after hour.
Now and then she heard the baby sighing in his
sleep&mdash;the poor little baby&mdash;and she straightened
up, a dim, rigid, attentive figure there in the darkness.
Once when the elder child awoke, sleepily
calling for a drink, she went to him, but she could
not stay; she came back again and resumed her
lonely vigil.</p>

<p>And still the hours went by. The low night
brooded over the slumbering town. Far down that
black and silent street, its shapes distorted and unfamiliar
in the shadows, she knew that his fate had
been decided. The early hours of the morning
brought their chill, and she shrugged herself more
closely in her shawl, clutched it more tightly to her
breast. And there in the window, alone, she
watched and waited while the night grew old and
waned.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="III-XII">XII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE crowd of men that filled Chris Steisfloss&rsquo;s
saloon were not reckoning the time that
night. They pressed, as many of them as
could, against the bar, and those who were huddled
behind this front rank stretched their arms between
the brushing shoulders for the glasses that Chris
himself and his bartender, both on duty, made
haste to fill each time some voice shouted an
order for drink. The long bar-room was stifling,
and the gas jets flared sickly, uncertainly, in their
efforts to keep alive in an atmosphere from which
the oxygen was so quickly exhausted.</p>

<p>Above the tilted hats of the gathering a cloud of
smoke drifted in thin, gray currents along the low
ceiling, following the drafts that puffed aimlessly
whenever the outer door opened, and let the cool
night air rush in with its sane and sanitary freshness.
Over all, as though a part of the low hanging
cloud of smoke, as though an element of the feculent
atmosphere, hung almost palpably the mass of
oaths and epithets, disjointed words and empty
phrases that were poured out in a mad dbcle by
all those excited voices. To this were added the
scrape and shuffle of boots, moving unsteadily on
the floor, and the click of glasses as these men
pledged anew a cause which by all the defiance of
their angry tones was evidently lost.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span></p>
<p>In the midst of them all, with his broad back
leaning against the rail that guarded the bar, was
Garwood himself. His rumpled shirt was open at
the throat, his cravat was gone, his soiled cuffs had
come unlinked and he fittingly portrayed in his
whole appearance the utter rout and demoralization
which had that day overtaken his political faction.
His eyes blazed now with the confused emotions
that ran riot in his soul, and now they lost all their
luster and seemed to be set in a filmy stare, until
their swollen lids fell heavily over them, to be
raised again only by an effort.</p>

<p>He had laid his hat down on the bar, where its
brim, flattening to the walnut surface, was soaking
up the liquor that had been spilled from an overturned
glass. In a strange whim of his disordered
mind he had commanded every one to let the hat
lie where it was, and they had all obeyed, with the
seriousness of drinking men. And there it reposed,
all its grace and expression gone, strangely typifying
the wreck of its wearer&rsquo;s fortunes.</p>

<p>As Garwood stood there, his black hair matted
to his brow, his cheeks and chin blue with a long
day&rsquo;s growth of the stubble of his beard, he suddenly
flung over his shoulder a peremptory order
to Steisfloss to fill the glasses again, and when the
saloon-keeper pushed the tall bottle toward him, he
turned half around and splashed a drink out of it
with an unsteady hand. Then holding the little
tumbler in a precarious grasp, he faced about again
and with elbows resting on the bar behind him, he
broke forth in a thick voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m beaten! Don&rsquo;t you think
it, I tell you! I may be beaten <i>now</i>, you understand,
but I&rsquo;m not <i>beaten</i>! No, sir! I&rsquo;ve only
begun. I tell you, I&rsquo;ve only begun. They can keep
me off the delegation, what do <i>I</i> care? I&rsquo;ll be at
Springfield just the same. They can send that
Singed Cat to Congress if they want to, what do I
care? Jim Rankin&mdash;Jim Rankin&mdash;who&rsquo;s he? I&rsquo;ll lick
&rsquo;em, I&rsquo;ll lick &rsquo;em <i>all</i>, every one, <i>yet</i>. You&rsquo;ll see, you
wait and see. You hear me? You wait and see. I&rsquo;ll
lick &rsquo;em all, every one, yet. I&rsquo;ll drive &rsquo;em out of the
district. I&rsquo;ll drive &rsquo;em out of the state, from the
Wabash on the east to the Mississippi on the west,
from Dunleith to Cairo. I&rsquo;ll set the buffalo grass
on fire and sweep the state clean of them. You will
not find one of them o&rsquo;er all the rolling prairies of
Illinois.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he rolled out the word &ldquo;Illinois,&rdquo; in the tone
the orators of that state use when they wish to show
their state pride, he swung his arm in an all-embracing
circle, and his auditors dodged the slopping
whisky.</p>

<p>Then he stood and blinked at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you fellows drink?&rdquo; he broke forth
again. &ldquo;What do you want to stand around that
way for? What are you afraid of? Jim Rankin?
Think I&rsquo;m licked, do you? Think I&rsquo;m dead politically,
do you? Well, I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em all.
Why don&rsquo;t you drink, Pusey; why don&rsquo;t you drink
up? Think I ain&rsquo;t got any money? Well, I&rsquo;ll show
you&mdash;Chris here knows me. I&rsquo;ll show you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pockets, produced a crumpled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>mass of green bills, and held them forth in his
fist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you there isn&rsquo;t room for them and me
on all the broad expanse of Illinois&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one struck up a favorite song of the campaign
platforms:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Not without thy wondrous story,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Illinois, Illinois;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be writ the nation&rsquo;s glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Illinois, Illinois;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the record of the years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abr&rsquo;ham Lincoln&rsquo;s name appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant and Logan&mdash;and our tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Illinois, Illinois.&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p>The crowd huddled more closely together, and
with heavy voices joined in the song. Some of the
men, with serio-comical expressions, essayed the
tenor, others the bass, though the bass predominated,
and they sang over and over the few words
of the song they could remember.</p>

<p>During this maudlin exhibition, the door opened,
and Rankin, with Bailey by his side, entered. Rankin
was bespattered from hat to heel, even his face
was freckled with the little spots where the viscous
mud had dried. His huge body was flaccid with
fatigue, and his appearance was enough to show
how heavily he had toiled at the polls that day in
his determination to defeat Garwood. Bailey
showed no sign of the equally hard day he had
spent. He walked with the same awkward, shambling
gait, his little eyes looked out from their narrowed
lids and roved about him with their customary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>cunning. He showed neither signs of exhaustion,
though he always looked tired, nor of the
elation that probably was in his breast at the great
victory which that day had been his.</p>

<p>Rankin, when he saw the crowd with Garwood
as its center, halted suddenly and jerked his hat
down over his eyes. He drew Bailey hurriedly to
the bar near the mirrored partition that screened
the scene within from the street without, and made
a sign to Steisfloss. The saloon-keeper, with an
alert appreciation of the situation which his long
experience with men in their cups had taught him,
silently moved that way, and bent a listening ear
toward the newcomers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us a little drink&mdash;an&rsquo; hurry. We&rsquo;ll get
out&mdash;don&rsquo;t let him see,&rdquo; said Rankin.</p>

<p>Steisfloss&rsquo;s heavy German face showed none of
the gratitude he felt, and quietly, almost surreptitiously,
he set glasses and bottle before the successful
candidate at that day&rsquo;s primaries and the
man who had brought his success to pass.</p>

<p>Before they could take their liquor, some one at
the edge of the crowd near Rankin noticed him.
Rankin&rsquo;s quick eye detected the recognition, and he
pulled the fellow toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him see us. I
didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s here, or we&rsquo;d not come in. We&rsquo;ll
duck. How long&rsquo;s he been in here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;ever since he got that last
news from the First Ward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin could not restrain the gleam of pleasure
that shot from his eye at the memory of that triumph,
but the gleam softened as he stole a look at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>Garwood, and then, at last, died quite away, and
there came in its stead an expression of pain and
pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Jerry!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;s a little off
when he came&mdash;&rdquo; he checked himself, and then&mdash;&ldquo;when
I saw him this afternoon,&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>He looked at him for another moment, and then
he said, angrily, to the man whom all the time he
kept between him and the crowd:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t some o&rsquo; you fellers get him out o&rsquo;
here? What do you want to let him disgrace himself
that-away fer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man looked at Rankin and shrugged his
shoulders to tell how helpless they all were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried,&rdquo; he said. He looked around toward
Garwood, who, having concluded another
speech, was tipping his glass into his mouth, his
head toppling on his neck as he did so. The man
turned back again to Rankin, still with that helpless
look, but, suddenly, with a flash of the eye as
if a new thought had just come to him, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You try, Jim; you could do it. He thinks more
of you to-day than of all the rest put together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rankin faced the bar and hastily swallowed his
bourbon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he and Bailey slipped away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Jerry!&rdquo; sighed Rankin, as they went out
the door.</p>

<p>But the Singed Cat, whose personality was destined
so soon to become the passion of the cartoonists,
turned and cast back at his defeated rival one
of those glances from his unsearchable little eyes.</p>

<h3 class="no-break" id="III-XIII">XIII</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>T the close of a day late in November Emily
Garwood came down the walk from the old
house that had been her home so long, and
at the gate paused for a backward glance of farewell.
The oaks under which for so many years she
had watched the coming and going of all she loved,
were barren, save for the few bronzed leaves that
clung with the tenacity of their species to the
gnarled boughs. Other leaves, withered and yellow,
that had succumbed to the common fate of
things, strewed the ground everywhere. Here and
there they had been pressed into wet mats by the
cold autumnal rains; otherwise they rustled with
the wind that ranged through the wide yard.</p>

<p>The night was falling swiftly, the darkness increasing
by visible degrees as if with the gradual
closing of some automatic shutter that was ultimately
to exclude the light. Black shadows rose
unexpectedly from the ground and silently enfolded
objects Emily had known so long that they had
become a part of her very life, so intimately associated
with all its experiences that she realized
her own affection for them but now, when she was
leaving them. The old home, to her sensitive imagination,
seemed to regard her out of its vacant,
lifeless windows with a cold and distant stare, as if
already it had begun to forget her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span></p>

<p>And so she closed the gate softly, as if the clash
of its latch might arouse memories that were
making ready to pursue her out of the old homestead,
drew more snugly into the hollow of her
arm the bundle of odds and ends she had gathered
up in her final inspection of its dismantled
rooms, and hurried away along Sangamon Avenue.
The atmosphere held in suspension many more
autumnal rains, with such a chill besides that her
little figure seemed to shrink with the cold, as it
dissolved in the shadows and disappeared.</p>

<p>The day of the primaries had marked the fall
of the last of Emily&rsquo;s ideals, and she felt, with her
old habit of fixing a formal duty for every occasion
that she must recognize the change by some definite,
decisive act. But as she gradually revolved the
problem life had set for her, and one after another
weighed all the common solutions that men and
women consider at such times&mdash;perhaps because of
sheer inability to grapple with such monstrous spiritual
difficulties&mdash;she shrank from them, finding
them all so sordid, so squalid, so inadequate to a
nature like hers. And so she lived on from day to
day, trying to reason it out, and failing in that,
awaiting the next scene in her domestic tragedy.</p>

<p>But nothing happened. Life went on somehow
as before. If at times she reproached herself with
what seemed her indecision, she strove with all
conscience to perform the little duties of each day,
until the great duty could be revealed clearly to her,
yet self-consciously wondering how it was that she
could think of common things, and do common
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>things, just as she had wondered, at the time her
father died, how it was, for instance, that she could
leave the solemn twilight of the chamber where she
had just witnessed the mystery of death, and
straightway go and eat her supper. She did not see
that her spirit was thus unconsciously struggling to
reassert itself; to identify itself anew with the common,
the real; to be like all else about it, for it had
not yet been given her to appreciate the love for the
normal, the abhorrence of the exceptional, the passion
for equality that nature reveals in her dealings
with her children.</p>

<p>She was convinced that she must have some kind
of reckoning with Jerome; something in a way
forensic and legal, with all the conventional elements
of trial, judgment and retribution or forgiveness;
at times she even dramatized the forms and
terms of this proceeding, which would atone for the
past, and leave them where they had been before.
But the auspicious moment never presented itself;
she realized at last that it could not come; that the
old ground had been lost, and lost forever; that
there could be nothing like resumption; that they
must begin, if at all, anew.</p>

<p>And so the summer had passed. She watched
Jerome narrowly, noting every change in humor,
in whim, in expression, thinking it possible that he
might broach the subject that lay so near the hearts
of both. At first, in a remorse that was evident,
he had been showing for her a new consideration;
a furtive consideration that was likely to exaggerate
its tenderness at times. He had sent her flowers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>and brought her candy, like a lover, and if these
silent appeals&mdash;while they touched her&mdash;did not altogether
reassure her, they must abundantly have
reassured him, for in the course of weeks he seemed
to have forgotten all save his own defeat. One
afternoon he had come home, silent and preoccupied,
and had moodily chosen to sit alone, staring
out the window, though seemingly oblivious to the
wonder and beauty of the October day, dying, like
the year, in serene and majestic dignity. His immovable
figure, there in the gloom, gradually oppressed
her, got on her nerves, and at last drew
her irresistibly into the room where he was. She
sat down quietly, without disturbing him, in the
hope that he would speak. She looked at him long,
but he did not speak, he did not move. Finally this
attitude became insupportable, and she at length
broke the stillness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jerome?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is the matter,&rdquo; he answered in an aggrieved
tone that altogether belied his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is,&rdquo; she insisted, quite in the old way.
&ldquo;You are blue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was silent a moment longer, in an ugly reluctance
to speak, and then,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, savagely, &ldquo;debts, if you want
to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sighed. The old sordid struggle after all!
He waited awhile longer, desiring her to coax him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span>out of his mood, but she said nothing, and at last
he was impelled to speak once more himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we are going to do,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;my creditors, now that I&rsquo;ve been beaten, are making
my office a rendezvous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke bitterly, as debtors do. He had leaned
forward, his elbows on his knees, his chin in his
palms, and he looked more gloomily than ever out
of the window. The light was just sufficient to
mark the outlines of his really fine head, while the
shadows of evening softened the lines in his face,
the harsh, unpleasant lines that a few years had
drawn there. She studied his profile, her eye caressing
his curls, the curls she remembered so well&mdash;remembered,
because she had a troubled sense of
thinking now of Jerome as in the past. She gazed
until the changes wrought by the short years of
their common life passed away, and she saw again
the Jerome of old&mdash;her own, her lost ideal....
If he had only gone down in some glorious conflict,
through some mighty sacrifice, some great devotion
to principle! Why had he failed? Had she
not tried to do all that a wife could to help and
guide him? If he had married some other woman,
some woman of courser fiber, who would not have
tried to keep him continually up to such high
ideals? She paused, some sudden shock smote her,
she felt her face grow cold and pale. Another
woman married to Jerome Garwood! She caught
her breath, her face burned as the blood rushed
back to her cheeks again, and then suddenly, impulsively,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span>she spoke, as much to herself, it seemed,
as to her husband:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>do</i> love you still, Jerome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her heart beat with a new fierce joy. A revelation
had come to her, a revelation that had solved
her problem in an instant, a thing her reason had
not been able to do in long months. She loved him
still! There was the solution to her riddle of life!
And this, this was the auspicious, the psychological
moment, come at last! She waited in agony for
him to speak, she leaned forward expectantly, and
he half turned his head. Her eyes widened, almost
flamed forth, as she felt, to meet his there in the
darkness that had suddenly become all light for her.
And then he laughed, a little laugh, that came
harsh on the stillness, and he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why of course you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes fell. He took it then, quite in the old
matter of course way! She turned her face aside,
sick with disappointment.</p>

<p>But the revelation of that passionate moment had
not been lost. It was to her, sure and certain. She
could not doubt it. That Jerome had taken it all
as he had could make no difference now to her.
For the revelation had solved her problem, made
her duty clear, and that was enough. The results
of the solution had not been those of her heart&rsquo;s
desire, but she could wait for that, for now she
beheld the light of a new theory, a new ideal, that
quickly glowed into an incandescence that illumined
her whole soul. Loving Jerome still, she must live
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span>for him still, and this without any regard to what
attitude he might take.</p>

<p>Her own happiness was of no importance; it
must come, if at all, as a secondary and indirect
result. The old ideal and the old ambition had
been, after all, but selfish, and so had failed not
only of realization, but of that nobler success that
comes through failure in the high endeavors of
life. She saw it all clearly now; when they had
together dreamed of a career, it was not with the
idea of being of real help to those about them,
but merely of lifting themselves to some place
that would distinguish them artificially from those
about them. And in time, pondering on her relations
to others in the world besides Jerome, she
found that what was true of her relation to him
was true of her relations to them; that her duty
was to live for them as well as for him.</p>

<p>Here was at last a worthy plan of existence, an
ideal, not of self, but service. It was simple when
she put it to herself in this literal way, so very
simple that it was almost trite, yet she had a conviction
that it was none the less mightily true.
She would not judge Jerome, but love him; she
would not expose his faults, but cover them with a
mantle of charity; a mantle so wide that it would
cover as well all others groping through the world
with their sins and their sufferings, their pitiable
failures and their lamentable mistakes, and if, even
by the slow and loving work of years, she could
win Jerome in time to this new ideal that had
arisen out of her darkness as the light of an autumn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>morning without clouds after long days of rain,
then, indeed, could his talents worthily be devoted
to the people he already thought he loved. Now
she had found the faith in life so necessary to her
existence. It was a new and better faith, and she
could wait long and patiently, if need be, for its
complete fulfilment.</p>

<p>Under the stimulus of this new-found faith in
life, in an almost pathetic determination to be practical&mdash;since
the sentimental seemed to be denied
her&mdash;she decided first that their affairs be placed
at once on a secure foundation. So with a touch
of her father&rsquo;s own uncompromising rigor in business
matters, she relentlessly cast up all their accounts,
and if she winced when the amount of Jerome&rsquo;s
debts stared her in the face, she nevertheless
bravely set about paying them off, devoting
to the purpose all her own income, now grown
small with the periodical return of hard times. And
then, last heroism of all, she resolved that they must
give up their old home. Jerome demurred a little,
but presently acquiesced.</p>

<p>He was interested anew in affairs, he had perhaps
had revelations of his own, and if he did not have
resolutions, he nevertheless had hopes. The campaign
was on again, and, in a spirit of what he
called party loyalty&mdash;as one who, winning or losing,
honorably lives up to all the rules of the game&mdash;he
was stumping the district, and making speeches
for the ticket with as much of his old fire as if he
had been on the ticket himself. Long before election
his old self-satisfaction had returned, he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span>as full of splendid schemes as a bumblebee, and if
his disinterestedness was not so apparent after
election, when he felt that his chances of being
appointed to a territorial judgeship were increasing
more and more as the short session of Congress
drew near, it may have been discovered in the fact
that, as an alternative, he had revived his old
project of going to Chicago to practise law. If
he got the territorial judgeship, they would have
to move West; in either event, he said, it did not
matter much where they lived for the time being.
He thought that if they went to Chicago he might
go to Congress from some of the Chicago districts&mdash;it
was not hard to get into politics there. But
Emily only smiled.</p>

<p>She found through Morton, a tenant for the
old home. She sent away the maids, even the nurse,
for whom the children cried, and Jasper, who cried
himself, until his very despair drove him to refuse
to accept the discharge at all. And then she found
a smaller house.</p>

<p>The last load of furniture had rumbled away in
a covered van that afternoon; as the early twilight
came she gave a final look into the empty corners
of the old home, picking up little things that had
been overlooked, and then, with an ache at the heart
for its emptiness and loneliness, she bade it farewell.
The moving had been an ordeal. She had
had all the care of it, though Jerome&rsquo;s mother had
helped, but beyond this was the spiritual agony of
coming across old things she had not seen for years,
things of her childhood, things of her girlhood; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>dress she had worn when first she met Jerome&mdash;he
had told her to preserve it, though he did not
know where it was&mdash;things, too, of her mother&rsquo;s&mdash;a
trying time for a soul already so heavily laden.</p>

<p>Now, hurrying along in the gloom of this November
evening, she glanced at the big houses of
the prosperous, and they repelled her with the flat
austerity of their own provincial exclusiveness. As
she advanced, these residences that had the effect
of casting her off, gradually gave way to homes,
rows of cottages, decreasing in size and importance;
but as they grew smaller, Emily observed that they
grew more companionable. Lights were beginning
to show in their windows, the men were getting in
from their work, and she could hear the homely
sounds of evening chores.</p>

<p>By the time she reached the humbler street
where she was henceforth to live, she felt a
sympathy with these unambitious homes, finding
a welcome, as it were, in the honest faces they
presented in the dusk. She gave them back a
brave little smile, reflecting her wish that she might
find the peace they seemed to shelter. Pursued
along those silent streets by the memories of the
old home, she sought refuge in planning the furnishing
of the new, mentally compressing the too
abundant furniture into the smaller compass with
which they must now content themselves.</p>

<p>And in her determination to begin anew, she
simulated for the sake of her own courage the pride
and joy of a bride&rsquo;s anticipation in setting up housekeeping.
Were they not really beginning after all?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>Had not the years since their marriage been years
of make-shift and make-believe? Were not those
years even now falling away behind her, while
brighter ones rose before? In the spring she would
have a little garden; she could imagine John Ethan
and his little sister playing among the flowers that
would riot there, their little heads bobbing in the
yellow sunlight. At the thought of the children
she quickened her steps.</p>

<p>The house at last came into sight, standing in a
small yard with a low picket fence about it. Some
boy was passing by, showing his neighborliness by
rattling a stick along the palings. John Ethan must
have known her step, light and hurried as it was,
for as she turned in at the gate the door of the
house opened, and he stood there in the light that
came from behind him. He was waiting for her.
He called to her to hurry, and she ran up the walk,
caught him in her arms, and hugged his little body
to her breast. The baby bad gone to sleep, too
tired to await her mother&rsquo;s coming. The grandmother
was cooking supper amidst the disorder of
the furniture and the boxes that had been crowded
into the kitchen. As Emily held her boy to her
breast, she felt the tears welling to her eyes, but she
told herself that this was not the time for tears, for
here began that new unselfish life in which she
hoped at some far off distant day to find the peace
and the happiness of which she had dreamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Fighting Bishop&rdquo; is drawn with firm, bold strokes
and with a sufficiently scholarly atmosphere to make the
picture life like. There is wisdom too, in the attitude of the
author toward his characters; and the entire atmosphere of
the book is of fine quality. The general accuracy and
vividness of the portraiture are likely to impress everyone.

some readers will find it difficult to forget.&mdash;<i>The Hartford

<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s musical son, Stephen&rsquo;s, obstinate vanity,
his irritable nervous nature, his impatience of advice and his
wonderful confidence in his own genius are admirably
brought out in the course of the narrative and the
chapter containing his letters to his brother is one of the
best in the book. It shows his character humorously and
without exaggeration, and this is typical of the whole story.
The author sees his personages with a human sympathic

<p>&ldquo;The Fifth String&rdquo; has a strong and clearly defined

sensitive temperament and his tremendous dramatic power.
It is a story of a marvelous violin, of a wonderful love and of
a strange temptation.</p>

<p>In this tale of merry England, of the time when
Shakespeare jested and Ben Jonson blustered, Mr.
Stephenson has painted for us a  picture informing and
above all entertaining. His is not a story of counts
and crowns, but of ever interesting common people.
Without seeming to do so the author shows us many
interesting bits of the life of the day. We go to Paul&rsquo;s
walk, we see Shakespeare at the Globe theatre and
other such glimpses of old time London are deftly added
to our experiences. Throughout the book is an evanescent
charm, a spirit of wholesome gaiety. It is well worth while.</p></div>

<p>The men and women in this story are children of the

persistent in enmity, determined in purpose.</p>

<p>The story is a story of great wrongs and of supreme love.
It is done in black and white, with few strokes, but they are
masterly. The shadows at the back are somber but the
value of contrast is appreciated for the vivid high light in
the foreground.</p>

<p>It is a work of art&mdash;powerful, convincing and abiding.
Powerful, because true to life; convincing, because it has the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
